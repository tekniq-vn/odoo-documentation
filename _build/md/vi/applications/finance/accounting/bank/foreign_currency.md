# Manage a bank account in a foreign currency

In Odoo, every transaction is recorded in the default currency of the company, and reports are all
based on that default currency. When you have a bank account in a foreign currency, for every
transaction, Odoo stores two values:

- The debit/credit in the currency of the *company*;
- The debit/credit in the currency of the *bank account*.

Currency rates are updated automatically using the web services of a banking institution. By
default, Odoo uses the European Central Bank's web services but other options are available.

Upon creation of the journal, Odoo automatically links the bank account to the journal. It can be
found under Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Accounting: Chart of Accounts.

## Vendor bill in a foreign currency

To pay a bill in a foreign currency, simply select the currency next to the Journal
field and register the payment. Odoo automatically creates and posts the foreign **exchange gain or
loss** as a new journal entry.

#### NOTE
Note that you can pay a foreign bill with another currency. In that case, Odoo automatically
converts between the two currencies.

## Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses Report

This report gives an overview of all unrealized amounts in a foreign currency on your balance sheet,
and allows you to adjust an entry or manually set an exchange rate. To access this report, go to
Reporting ‚Ä£ Management: Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses. From here, you have
access to all open entries in your **balance sheet**.

![View of the Unrealized Gains/Losses journal.](../../../../_images/foreign-gains-losses.png)

If you wish to use a different currency rate than the one set in Accounting ‚Ä£
Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings ‚Ä£ Currencies, click the Exchange Rates button and change
the rate of the foreign currencies in the report.

![Menu to manually change exchange rates.](../../../../_images/foreign-exchange-rates.png)

When manually changing **exchange rates**, a yellow banner appears allowing you to reset back to
Odoo's rate. To do so, simply click on Reset to Odoo's Rate.

![Banner to reset back to Odoo's rates.](../../../../_images/foreign-reset-rates.png)

In order to update your **balance sheet** with the amount of the adjustment column,
click on the Adjustment Entry button. In the pop-up window, select a
Journal, Expense Account and Income Account to calculate and
process the **unrealized gains and losses**.

You can set the date of the report in the Date field. Odoo automatically reverses the
booking entry to the date set in Reversal Date.

Once posted, the adjustment column should indicate `0.00`, meaning all **unrealized
gains/losses** have been adjusted.
