# Default terms and conditions (T&C)

Specifying terms and conditions is essential to establish important contractual points, such as
return and refunds, warranty, and after-sale services.

You can add default terms and conditions at the bottom of all customer invoices, sales orders, and
quotations, either as text or a link to a web page.

Alternatively, to display the terms and conditions on a web page, select the Add a link
to a Web Page option and click Save. Click Update Terms, edit the
content, and click Save. The link to that page is then added as a note in your document.

#### NOTE
You can edit the layout and content of the page using the [Website](../../../websites/website/) app. If the Website app is activated, the Edit in
Website Builder option then replaces Update Terms.
