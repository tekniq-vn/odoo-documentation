# Batch payments: SEPA Direct Debit (SDD)

SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area, is a payment-integration initiative of the European Union for
simplification of bank transfers denominated in euros. With **SEPA Direct Debit** (SDD), your
customers can sign a mandate that authorizes you to collect future payments from their bank
accounts. This is particularly useful for recurring payments based on a subscription.

You can record customer mandates in Odoo, and generate `.xml` files containing pending payments made
with an SDD mandate.

#### NOTE
SDD is supported by all SEPA countries, which includes the 27 member states of the European
Union as well as additional countries.

## SEPA Direct Debit Mandates

### Create a mandate

The  Mandate is the document that your customers sign to authorize
you to collect money directly from their bank accounts.

To create a new mandate, go to Accounting app ‣ Customers ‣
Direct Debit Mandates, on Create, and fill out the form. Export the PDF file by
clicking on Print. It is then up to your customer to sign this document. Once done,
upload the signed file and click on Validate to start running the mandate.

#### IMPORTANT
Make sure that the **IBAN bank accounts details** are correctly recorded on the debtor’s contact
form, under the Accounting tab, and in your own [Bank Account](applications/finance/accounting/bank.md) settings.

### SEPA Direct Debit as a payment method

Phương thức SDD có thể được sử dụng để thanh toán trên cả **Thương mại điện tử** và **Cổng thông tin khách hàng** bằng cách kích hoạt SDD làm **Nhà cung cấp dịch vụ thanh toán**. Với phương thức này, khách hàng của bạn có thể tạo ủy nhiệm. Để đảm bảo tính hợp lệ của thông tin do khách hàng cung cấp, họ sẽ phải xác nhận từng ủy nhiệm bằng một lần chuyển khoản ngân hàng thành công với số tiền yêu cầu.

To do so, go to Accounting app ‣ Configuration ‣ Payment Providers, click on
SEPA Direct Debit.

#### IMPORTANT
Make sure to change the State field to Enabled and set the provider as
"Published" so that it is available for your customers.

Customers using SDD as payment method get prompted to add their IBAN, email address, and to sign
their SEPA Direct Debit mandate.

### Close or revoke a mandate

Direct debit mandates are closed automatically after their End Date. If this field is
left blank, the mandate keeps being **Active** until it is **Closed** or **Revoked**.

Clicking on Close updates the mandate’s end day to the current day. This means that
invoices issued after the present day will not be processed with an SDD payment.

Clicking on Revoke disables the mandate immediately. No SDD payment can be registered
anymore, regardless of the invoice’s date. However, payments that have already been registered are
still included in the next SDD `.xml` file.

#### WARNING
Once a mandate has been closed or revoked, it cannot be reactivated.

## Get paid with SEPA Direct Debit batch payments

### Hóa đơn bán hàng

You can register SDD payments for invoices issued to customers who have an active SDD mandate.

To do so, open the invoice, click on Register Payment, and choose
SEPA Direct Debit as payment method.

### Generate SEPA Direct Debit `.XML` files to submit payments

`.xml` files with all SDD payment instructions can be uploaded to your online banking interface
to process all payments at once.

#### NOTE
The files generated by Odoo follow the SEPA Direct Debit **PAIN.008.001.02** specifications, as
required by the SEPA customer-to-bank [implementation guidelines](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/implementation-guidelines/sepa-credit-transfer-customer-psp-implementation),
which ensures compatibility with the banks.

To generate your `.xml` file of multiple pending SDD payments, you can create a batch payment.
To do so, go to Accounting app ‣ Customers ‣ Payments, select the needed
payments, then click on Action, and finally Create a batch Payment. Once
you click on Validate, the `.xml` file is directly available for download.

Finally, upload this file to your online banking interface to process the payments.
