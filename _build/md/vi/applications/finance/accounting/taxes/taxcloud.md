# TaxCloud integration

#### WARNING
The out-of-the-box Odoo TaxCloud integration has begun its decommissioning. Starting in Odoo 17,
new installations are prohibited, and in Odoo 18 the TaxCloud module(s) won't exist at all. Odoo
recommends the use of the Avatax platform.

If you are hosted on-premise or on Odoo.SH and you wish to use Taxcloud, you can contact them
