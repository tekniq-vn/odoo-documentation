### Non-deductible taxes

In Belgium, some taxes are not fully deductible, such as taxes on the maintenance of cars. This
means a part of these taxes is considered as an expense.

In Odoo, you can configure non-deductible taxes by creating tax rules for these taxes and linking
them to the corresponding accounts. This way, the system automatically calculates the taxes and
allocates them to the appropriate accounts.

To configure a new non-deductible tax, go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£
Accounting: Taxes, and click New:

1. Add a line and select Base in the Based On column;
2. Add a line, then select on tax in the Based on column and
   enter the **non-deductible** percentage in the % column;
3. On the of tax line, select the Tax Grid(s) related to your tax;
4. Add a line with the **deductible** percentage in the % column;
5. Set of tax in Based On;
6. Select 411000 VAT recoverable as account, and select the related tax grid.

Once you have created a non-deductible tax, you can apply it to your transactions by selecting the
appropriate tax during the encoding of bills and credit notes. The system automatically calculates
the tax amount and allocates it to the corresponding accounts based on the tax rules configured.

configured, i.e., the country is set to Belgium and the Tax ID or
Company ID field is filled.

1. Go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, then go to the
   CodaBox & SODA section.
2. Click on Manage Connection to open the connection wizard, which shows the
   Company VAT/ID number that will be used for the connection.

   Odoo during the first connection will be requested to create a new connection.
   > #### NOTE
   > This Password is unique to Odoo and must be stored securely
   > on your side.

For accounting firms

#### NOTE
Accounting firms must manage their clients on separate databases and configure them
individually to avoid mixing up their data. The connection must be made by an accounting
firm with valid CodaBox Connect credentials.
In the following instructions, we will refer to your client's company as *Company* and to
your accounting firm as *Accounting Firm*.

#### IMPORTANT
Make sure the [company settings](../../general/companies.md) are correctly
configured, i.e., the country is set to Belgium, the Tax ID or
Company ID and Accounting Firm fields are filled, as well as the
Tax ID of the Accounting Firm.

1. Go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, then go to the
   CodaBox & SODA section.

## Cash discount

In Belgium, if an early payment discount is offered on an invoice, the tax is calculated based on
the discounted total amount, whether the customer benefits from the discount or not.

To apply the right tax amount and report it correctly in your VAT return, set the tax reduction as
Always (upon invoice).

<a id="belgium-pos-restaurant-certification"></a>

## Fiscal certification: POS restaurant

In Belgium, the owner of a cooking business such as a restaurant or food truck is required by law to
use a government-certified **Cash Register System** for their receipts. This applies if their yearly
earnings (excluding VAT, drinks, and take-away food) exceed 25,000 euros.

This government-certified system entails the use of a [certified POS system](#belgium-certified-pos), along with a device called a [Fiscal Data Module](#belgium-fdm) (or
**black box**) and a [VAT Signing Card](#belgium-vat).

#### IMPORTANT
Do not forget to register as *foodservice industry manager* on the [Federal Public Service
Finance registration form](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/enregistrement).

<a id="belgium-certified-pos"></a>

### H·ªá th·ªëng POS ƒë∆∞·ª£c ch·ª©ng nh·∫≠n

The Odoo POS system is certified for the major versions of databases hosted on **Odoo Online**,
**Odoo.sh**, and **On-Premise**. Please refer to the following table to ensure that your POS system
is certified.

|           | Odoo Online   | Odoo.sh   | On-Premise   |

[Phi√™n b·∫£n ƒë∆∞·ª£c h·ªó tr·ª£](../../../administration/supported_versions.md)

A [certified POS system](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/systemes-certifies) must
adhere to rigorous government regulations, which means it operates differently from a non-certified
POS.

- On a certified POS, you cannot:
  - Set up and use the **global discounts** feature (the `pos_discount` module is blacklisted and
    cannot be activated).
  - Set up and use the **loyalty programs** feature (the `pos_loyalty` module is blacklisted and
    cannot be activated).
  - Reprint receipts (the `pos_reprint` module is blacklisted and cannot be activated).
  - Modify prices in order lines.
  - Modify or delete order lines in POS orders.
  - Sell products without a valid VAT number.
  - Use a POS that is not connected to an IoT box.
- The [cash rounding](../../sales/point_of_sale/pricing/cash_rounding.md) feature must be
  activated and set to a Rounding Precision of `0,05` and a Rounding Method
  set as Half-Up.
- Taxes must be set as included in the price. To set it up, go to Point of Sale ‚Ä£
  Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, and from the Accounting section, open the
  Default Sales Tax form by clicking the arrow next to the default sales tax field.
  There, click Advanced Options and enable Included in Price.
- At the start of a POS session, users must click Work in to clock in. Doing so allows
  the registration of POS orders. If users are not clocked in, they cannot make POS orders.
  Likewise, they must click Work Out to clock out at the end of the session.

#### WARNING
If you configure a POS to work with a , you cannot use it again
without it.

<a id="belgium-fdm"></a>

### Fiscal Data Module (FDM)

An FDM, or **black box**, is a government-certified device that works together with the Point of
Sale application and saves your POS orders information. Concretely, a **hash** ()
is generated for each POS order and added to its receipt. This allows the government to verify that
all revenue is declared.

#### WARNING
Only the FDM from **Bo√Ætenoire.be** with the [FDM certificate number BMC04](https://www.systemedecaisseenregistreuse.be/fr/systemes-certifies#FDM%20certifi√©s) is
supported by Odoo. [Contact the manufacturer (GCV BMC)](https://www.bo√Ætenoire.be/contact) to
order one.

#### C·∫•u h√¨nh

Before setting up your database to work with an FDM, ensure you have the following hardware:

- a **Bo√Ætenoire.be** (certificate number BMC04) FDM;
- an RS-232 serial null modem cable per FDM;
- an RS-232 serial-to-USB adapter per FDM;
- an [IoT Box](#belgium-iotbox) (one IoT box per FDM); and
- m√°y in bi√™n lai.

<a id="belgium-blackbox"></a>

##### Black box module

As a pre-requisite, [activate](../../general/apps_modules.md#general-install) the `Belgian Registered Cash Register` module
(technical name: `pos_blackbox_be`).

You must configure the  directly in the production database.
Utilizing it in a testing environment may result in incorrect data being stored within the FDM.

<a id="belgium-iotbox"></a>

##### H·ªôp IoT

In order to use an , you need a registered IoT Box. To register your
IoT box, you must contact us through our [support contact form](https://www.odoo.com/help) and
provide the following information:

- m√£ s·ªë thu·∫ø GTGT¬†c·ªßa b·∫°n,
- your company's name, address, and legal structure; and
- the Mac address of your IoT Box.

Once your IoT box is certified, [connect](../../general/iot/connect.md) it to your database. To
verify that the IoT Box recognizes the FDM, go to the IoT homepage and scroll down the
IOT Device section, which should display the FDM.

![Hardware status page on a registered IoT Box](../../../_images/iot-devices.png)

Then, add the IoT to your POS. To do so, go to Point of Sale ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£
Point of Sale, select your POS, scroll down to the Connected Device section, and enable
IoT Box. Lastly, add the FMD in the Fiscal Data Module field.

#### NOTE
