### Sales and purchase tax report

To generate a sales and purchase tax report, go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Reporting ‚Ä£ Tax
Report. Select a specific time or time range on the tax report, and click
VAT-202-01 (xlsx) for purchase tax and VAT-202-02 (xlsx) for sales tax.

### Withholding PND tax report

PND report data displays the summarized amounts of the applicable **withholding corporate income
tax returns (domestic)** from vendor bills under the PND53 (TH) and
PND3 (TH) tax reports. It is installed by default with the Thai localization.

![PND tax reports](applications/finance/fiscal_localizations/thailand/pnd-report.png)

#### NOTE
Withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic) is the tax used in case the company has
withheld the tax from ‚Äú**Personal (PND3)**‚Äù or ‚Äú**Corporate (PND53)**‚Äù services provided such as
rental, hiring, transportation, insurance, management fee, consulting, etc.

The PND tax report allows users to generate a CSV file for bills to upload on the
[RDprep for Thailand e-Filling application](https://efiling.rd.go.th/rd-cms/).

To generate a PND CSV file, go to Accounting ‚Ä£ Reporting ‚Ä£ Tax Report, select a
specific time or time range on the tax report, and click PND3 or PND53.

This generates the `Tax Report PND3.csv` and `Tax Report PND53.csv` files that lists all
the vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.

![PND3 and PND53 CSV files](applications/finance/fiscal_localizations/thailand/pnd3-pnd53.png)

#### WARNING
Odoo cannot generate the PND or PDF report or **withholding tax certificate** directly. The
generated `Tax Report PND3.csv` and `Tax Report PND53.csv` files must be exported
to an external tool to convert them into a **withholding PND** report or a **PDF** file.
