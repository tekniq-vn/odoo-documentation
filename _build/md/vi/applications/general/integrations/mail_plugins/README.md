Mail Plugins are connectors that bridge your mailbox with your Odoo database. With them, you can\
interact with your Odoo database directly from your mailbox by:

* Creating leads and centralizing prospects' emails into the CRM app.
* Generating tasks in any Odoo project.
* Creating tickets in the Helpdesk app.
* Searching and storing insights on your contacts.

Mail Plugins are available for [Outlook](mail_plugins/outlook.md) and [Gmail](mail_plugins/gmail.md).

## Định giá

Mail Plugins are **free** to install and use.

However, they can provide **Lead Enrichment**, which is part of a paid service known as **Lead**\
**Generation**.

Mail plugins allow you to test Lead Enrichment for free, whether you connect the plugins to a
database or not. After a while, the plugins ask you to buy [Mua hàng trong ứng dụng (IAP)](../../essentials/in_app_purchase.md)
credits if you would like to keep using this service.

### Lead Generation IAP service

Lead Enrichment uses the _Lead Generation IAP service_. Each request consumes one _Lead Generation_\
_credit_.

To buy credits, go to Settings ‣ CRM ‣ Lead Enrichment ‣ Buy credits and\
select a package.

#### NOTE

* If you are out of credits, the only information populated when clicking on the suggested\
  company is its website link and logo.
* Check out the [Lead Generation IAP service Privacy Policy](https://iap.odoo.com/privacy#header_3).
