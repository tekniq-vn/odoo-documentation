# Unsplash

**Unsplash** is a recognized stock photography library integrated with Odoo.

If your database is hosted on **Odoo Online**, you can access Unsplash pictures without
configuration.

If your database is hosted on **Odoo.sh or on-premise**, proceed as follows:

1. To **generate an Unsplash access key**, create or sign in to an [Unsplash account](https://unsplash.com).
2. Access your [applications dashboard](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications), click
   New Application, select all checkboxes, and click Accept terms.
3. In the pop-up window, enter your Application Name, starting with the
   prefix `Odoo:` (e.g., `Odoo: connection`), so Unsplash recognizes it as an Odoo instance. Then,
   add a Description and click Create application.
4. On the application details page, scroll down to the Keys section and copy the
   Access Key and Application ID.
5. In Odoo, go to General Settings and enable the Unsplash Image
   Library feature. Then, enter the Unsplash Access Key and Application ID.

#### WARNING
As a non-Odoo Online user, you are limited to a test key with a maximum of 50 Unsplash requests
per hour.
