# Internet Vạn vật (IoT)

Odoo Internet of Things (IoT) allows to connect physical devices such as barcode scanners, receipt
printers, payment terminals, measurement tools, etc. to an Odoo database using an IoT system.

The following IoT systems are supported:

- [IoT box](iot/iot_box.md): micro-computer, plug-and-play device (i.e., the Odoo IoT program is
  pre-installed);
- [Windows virtual IoT](iot/windows_iot.md): Odoo IoT program for Windows that can be installed
  on a Windows computer.

#### NOTE
-  devices, including cameras and measurement tools,
  are not compatible with Windows virtual IoT.
- Multiple IoT systems can be used at the same time.
- It is also possible to create a Windows Virtual Machine on a MacOS/Linux computer. However,
  this option is not supported by Odoo, and no troubleshooting assistance will be provided.

## IoT box subscription

An IoT box subscription is required for production use of IoT systems. If you have issues related
to your subscription, contact the database's account manager or Odoo partner for assistance.
