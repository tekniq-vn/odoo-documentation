*Access rights* are permissions that determine the content and applications users can access and
edit. In Odoo, these permissions can be set for individual users or for groups of users. Limiting
permissions to only those who need them ensures that users do not modify or delete anything they
should not have access to.

**Only** an *administrator* can change access rights.

## Ng∆∞·ªùi d√πng

The access rights for [individual users](../users.md#users-add-individual) are set when the user is added
to the database, but they can be adjusted at any point in the user's profile.

To make changes to a user's rights, click on the desired user to edit their profile.

![Users menu in the Users & Companies section of the Settings app of Odoo.](applications/general/users/access_rights/navigate-to-users-menu.png)

On the user's profile page, in the Access Rights tab, scroll down to view the current
permissions.

For each app, use the drop-down menu to select what level of permission this user should have. The
options vary for each section, yet the most common are: Blank/None, User: Own
Documents, User: All Documents, or Administrator.

The Administration field in the Access Rights tab has the following options:
Settings or Access Rights.

## Create and modify groups

*Groups* are app-specific sets of permissions that are used to manage common access rights for a
large amount of users. Administrators can modify the existing groups in Odoo, or create new ones to
define rules for models within an application.

To access groups, first activate Odoo's [developer mode](../developer_mode.md#developer-mode), then go to
Settings app ‚Ä£ Users & Companies ‚Ä£ Groups.

![Groups menu in the Users & Companies section of the Settings app of Odoo.](applications/general/users/access_rights/click-users-and-companies.png)

To create a new group from the Groups page, click Create. Then, from the
blank group form, select an Application, and complete the group form (detailed below).

To modify existing groups, click on an existing group from the list displayed on the
Groups page, and edit the contents of the form.

Enter a Name for the group and tick the checkbox next to Share Group, if
this group was created to set access rights for sharing data with some users.

#### IMPORTANT
Always test the settings being changed to ensure they are being applied to the correct users.

The group form contains multiple tabs for managing all elements of the group. In each tab, click
Add a line to add a new row for users or rules, and click the ‚ùå (remove)
icon to remove a row.

![Tabs in the Groups form to modify the settings of the group.](applications/general/users/access_rights/groups-form.png)
- Users tab: lists the current users in the group. Users listed in black have
  administrative rights. Users without administrative access appear in blue. Click Add a
  line to add users to this group.
- Inherited tab: Inherited means that users added to this group are automatically added
  to the groups listed on this tab. Click Add a line to add inherited groups.
- Menus tab: defines which models the group can have access to. Click
  Add a line to add a specific menu.
- Views tab: lists which views in Odoo the group has access to. Click Add a
  line to add a view to the group.
- Access Rights tab: lists the first level of rights (models) that this group has. The
  Name column represents the name for the current group's access to the model
  selected in the Model column.

  To link a new access right to a group, click Add a line. Select the appropriate model
  from the Model dropdown, then enter a name for the access right in the
  Name column. For each model, enable the following options as appropriate:
  - Read: Users can see the object's existing values.
  - Write: Users can edit the object's existing values.
  - Create: Users can create new values for the object.
  - Delete: Users can delete values for the object.
- Record Rules: lists the second layer of editing and visibility rights.
  Record Rules overwrite, or refine, the group's access rights. Click Add a
  line to add a record rule to this group. For each rule, choose values for the following options:
  - Apply for Read.
  - Apply for Write.
  - Apply for Create.
  - Apply for Delete.

  #### IMPORTANT
  Record rules are written using a *domain*, or conditions that filter data. A domain expression
  is a list of such conditions. For example:

  `[('mrp_production_ids', 'in', user.partner_id.commercial_partner_id.production_ids.ids)]`

  This record rule is to enable MRP consumption warnings for subcontractors.

  Odoo has a library of preconfigured record rules for ease of use. Users without knowledge of
  domains (and domain expressions) should consult an Odoo Business Analyst, or the Odoo Support
  Team, before making changes.

## Superuser mode

*Superuser mode* allows the user to bypass record rules and access rights. To activate *Superuser
mode*, first, activate [developer mode](../developer_mode.md#developer-mode). Then, navigate to the *debug* menu,
represented by a ü™≤ (bug) icon, located in the top banner.

Finally, towards the bottom of the menu, click Become Superuser.

#### IMPORTANT
Only users with *Settings* access for the *Administration* section of the *Access Rights* (in
their user profile) are allowed to log in to *Superuser mode*.

To leave *Superuser mode*, log out of the account, by navigating to the upper-right corner, and
clicking on the OdooBot username. Then, select the Log out option.
