To properly maintain a fleet of vehicles, regular maintenance as well as periodic repairs are
needed. Scheduling repairs and managing services for an entire fleet is necessary to ensure all
vehicles are in good working order when they are needed.

<a id="fleet-service-form"></a>

## Create service records

To log a service for a vehicle, go to the main Services dashboard by navigating to
Fleet app ‚Ä£ Fleet ‚Ä£ Services. Open a new service form by clicking the
New button in the top-left corner.

Fill out the information on the form. The only two fields that are required to be populated are
Service Type and Vehicle.

The service form automatically saves as data is entered. However, the form can be saved manually at
any time by clicking the Save manually option, represented by a (cloud
upload) icon.

The fields on the form are:

- Description: enter a brief description of the service.
- Service Type: select the type of service performed using the drop-down menu. Or, enter
  a new type of service, and click either Create "service type" or Create and
  edit... to [add the service type and configure it](#fleet-new-type).

  #### IMPORTANT
  Service Types are **not** pre-configured in Odoo. When logging a service for the
  first time, the *type* of service needs to be [created](#fleet-new-type) before it can be
  selected.
- Date: using the calendar popover window, select the date the service was provided, or
  is scheduled to be performed. Navigate to the desired month using the < > (arrow)
  icons, then click on the date to select it.
- Cost: enter the cost of the service.
- Vendor: select the vendor who performed the service using the drop-down menu. If the
  vendor has not already been entered in the system, type in the vendor name, and click either
  Create to add them, or Create and edit... to [add and configure the
  vendor](#fleet-new-vendor).
- Vehicle: select the vehicle that was serviced from the drop-down menu. When the
  vehicle is selected, the Driver field is populated, and the unit of measure for the
  Odometer Value field appears.
- Driver: the current driver listed for the selected vehicle is populated when the
  Vehicle is selected. If the driver needs to be changed, another driver can be selected
  from the drop-down menu.
- Odometer Value: enter the odometer reading when the service was done. The units of
  measure are either in kilometers (km) or miles (mi), depending on how the
  selected vehicle was configured.

  When the Vehicle is selected, the unit of measure for this field is populated. This
  comes from the vehicle form.
- Notes: enter any notes for the repair at the bottom of the service form.

<a id="fleet-new-type"></a>

### Create service type

Service types must be created from a service form. There is no other way to access the list of
service types.

On the [service form](#fleet-service-form), type in the name of the new Service
Type in the corresponding field. Then, click Create and edit..., and a
Create Service Type pop-up form appears.

The service type entered on the service form automatically populates the Name field,
which can be modified, if desired.

Then, select the Category for the new service type from the drop-down menu in that
field. The two default options to choose from are Contract or Service.
Additional categories **cannot** be created.

If the service applies to **only** contracts or services, select the corresponding
Category. If the service applies to **both** contracts *and* services, leave this field
blank.

When done, click Save & Close.

<a id="fleet-new-vendor"></a>

### Create vendor

When a service is done for the first time, typically, the vendor is not in the database yet. It is
best practice to add the full details for a vendor in the database, so that any necessary
information can be easily retrieved.

On the [service form](#fleet-service-form), type in the name of the new Vendor in
the corresponding field. Then, click Create and edit..., and a Create
Vendor form appears.

The vendor name entered on the service form populates the Name field, by default. This
field can be modified, if desired.

#### NOTE
Different tabs or fields may be visible on the Create Vendor form, depending on what
other applications are installed.

#### General information

Fill out the following information in the top-half of the form:

- Individual or Company: select whether the new vendor being added is an
  individual or a company, by clicking the corresponding radio button.

  When a selection is made, some fields may disappear from the form. If any of the fields below are
  not visible, that is because Company was selected, instead of Individual.
- Name: enter a name for the individual or company in this field.
- Company Name: using the drop-down menu, select the company that the vendor is
  associated with, if any.

  If the Company radio button at the top of the form is selected, this field does not
  appear.
- Contact: enter the contact information in this section.

  If desired, the Contact field can be changed to a different type of contact. Click on
  Contact to reveal a drop-down menu. The available options to select are
  Contact, Invoice Address, Delivery Address,
  Follow-up Address, or Other Address.

  If desired, select one of these other options for the Contact field, and enter the
  corresponding information.

  If Company is selected for the  Individual or Company field,
  this field is labeled Address, and **cannot** be modified.
- Tax ID: enter the vendor's tax ID in this field.
- Job Position: enter the vendor's job position in this field. If the
  Company radio button at the top of the form is selected, this field does not appear.
- Phone: enter the vendor's phone number in this field.
- Mobile: enter the vendor's mobile number in this field.
- Email: enter the vendor's email address in this field.
- Website: enter the vendor's website address in this field.
- Title: using the drop-down menu, select the vendor's title in this field. The default
  options are Doctor, Madam, Miss, Mister, and
  Professor.

  If the Company radio button at the top of the form is selected, this field does not
  appear.
- Tags: using the drop-down menu, select any tags that apply to the vendor.

  To add a new tag, type in the tag, then click Create "tag".

  There is no limit to the number of tags that can be selected.
- Image: a photo of either the main contact person, or the company logo, can be added to
  the form. Hover over the üì∑ (camera) box, in the top-right of the form, to reveal a
  ‚úèÔ∏è (pencil) icon, and click it. A file explorer window appears. Navigate to the
  desired file, then click Open to select it.

##### Tab Li√™n h·ªá & ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ

After the top-half of the Create Vendor form is filled out, add any other contacts and
addresses associated with the vendor in this tab.

Click the Add button to add a new contact, and a Create Contact pop-up
window appears.

Select one of the appropriate contact type options from the radio buttons, located at the top of the
pop-up window. Those options are as follows:

- Contact: select this option to add general contact details for employees of the
  associated vendor.
- Invoice Address: select this option to add a preferred address for all invoices. When
  added to the form, this address is selected by default when sending an invoice to the associated
  vendor.
- Delivery Address: select this option to add a preferred address for all deliveries.
  When added to the form, this address is selected by default when delivering an order to the
  associated vendor.
- Follow-up Address: select this option to add a preferred address for all follow-up
  correspondence. When added to the form, this address is selected by default when sending reminders
  about overdue invoices.
- Other Address: select this option to add any other necessary addresses for the vendor.

###### B√°n h√†ng

- Salesperson: using the drop-down menu, select a user as the main point of contact for
  sales with this vendor.

## List of services

To view all services logged in the database, including old and new requests, navigate to
Fleet app ‚Ä£ Fleet ‚Ä£ Services. All services appear in a list view, including all
the details for each service.

The service records are grouped by [service type](#fleet-new-type). The number of repairs for
each service type appears in parentheses after the name of the service type.

Each service listed displays the following information:

- Date: the date that the service, or repair, was performed (or requested to be
  performed).
- Description: a short description of the specific type of service, or repair, performed
  to clarify the specific service.
- Service Type: the type of service, or repair, performed. This is selected from a list
  of services that [must be configured](#fleet-new-type).
- Vehicle: the specific vehicle the service was performed on.
- Driver: the current driver for the vehicle.
- Vendor: the specific vendor who performed the service, or repair.
- Notes: any information associated with the service, or repair, that is documented to
  add clarification.
- Cost: the total cost of the service, or repair.
- Stage: the status of the service, or repair. Options are New,
  Running, Done, or Canceled.

At the bottom of the Cost column, the total cost of all services and repairs are listed.

### View services

It is recommended to view the list of services in one of several pre-configured ways to better view
the information presented. In the top-right corner of the list, there are several icons that when
clicked, sort the data in different ways.

![The icons in the top right corner than can be clicked to present the information in
different ways.](applications/hr/fleet/service/views.png)

#### Xem danh s√°ch

The default view of the service records is a list view. This presents all the services, first
grouped alphabetically by type of service, then grouped by status.

The information can be re-sorted by any column. At the top of each column, hover over the column
name, and an arrow appears in the far-right of that column. Click the arrow to sort the data by that
specific column.

The default sorting is in descending alphabetical order (A to Z), represented by a ‚åÑ
(down arrow) icon. Click the ‚åÑ (down arrow) icon to reverse the alphabetical order (Z
to A). The ‚åÑ (down arrow) icon changes to an ^ (up arrow) icon.

The two exceptions to this sorting are the default Date column and the Cost
column. The Date column sorts the information in chronological order (January to
December), instead of alphabetical order. The Cost column sorts the information by
repair price, from lowest to highest.

##### Add a service

To add a service record from the list view, click the New button, and a service form
loads. [Enter all the information](#fleet-service-form) on the service form.

The form automatically saves as data is entered.

#### Ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô xem kanban

To view services by their stage, click the Kanban button, which is the second icon in
the top-right corner, and appears as two different length bars beneath a line.

All services are organized by service type, and appear in the corresponding Kanban column.

The number of repairs for each type of service appears in the far-right of each Kanban column
header.

The collective status of the scheduled activities for each service type appears in the color-coded
bar beneath each Kanban column title. Repairs with activities scheduled in the future appear green,
activities due today appear yellow, overdue activities appear red, and repairs with no activities
scheduled appear gray.

A new repair can be added from this view. Click the ‚ûï (plus icon) in the top-right
corner of the Kanban column, and a new block appears at the top of the column, beneath the Kanban
title.

Enter a Title for the service or repair, then click Add. A
Create service form appears in a pop-up window. [Enter all the information](#fleet-service-form) on the service form, then click Save & Close to add the record.

icon, which is the third icon in the top-right, and appears as a small graph.

The default graph view displays the service information in a stacked bar chart, grouped by
Service Type. The X-axis represents the Service Type and the Y-axis
represents the Cost.

Each column visually represents the total cost for all repairs and services for that specific
Service Type. Hover over any bar to reveal a popover window that displays the total
Cost for the service and repairs the bar represents.

The graph can change to either a Line Chart or a Pie Chart by clicking the
corresponding button above the graph. Additionally, the graph can display the data in either

#### Ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô xem pivot

Another way to view the service data is in a spreadsheet pivot table. Click the Pivot
icon, which is the fourth icon in the top-right, and appears as a small spreadsheet.

The default way the data is presented shows the total cost of each type of service. The horizontal
rows represent the various types of service, with a different service type in its own line. The
vertical columns represent the total costs for each specific type of service, further divided by the
type of service.

![The default pivot table view of the services.](applications/hr/fleet/service/pivot.png)

The table can either be inserted in a spreadsheet or downloaded, if desired.

To add the pivot table to a spreadsheet in Odoo, first, the appearance of the pivot table must
change. The default pivot table view does not allow it to be inserted into a spreadsheet (the
Insert in Spreadsheet button is grayed out).

First, click the ‚ûñ (minus) icon to the left of Total at the top of the pivot
table. This collapses the service types, leaving only a single Cost column visible.

Then, click the Insert in Spreadsheet button, which is no longer grayed out, and a
Select a spreadsheet to insert your pivot pop-up window appears. Two tabs are visible in
this pop-up window, a Spreadsheets tab and a Dashboards tab.

Click the desired tab to indicate where the spreadsheet should be placed, either in a
Spreadsheet or on a Dashboard. After clicking the desired option, click
Confirm. The spreadsheet then loads on the screen.

#### NOTE
Spreadsheets are stored in Odoo's *Documents* application, while dashboards are stored in Odoo's
*Dashboards* application.

Click Services in the top-left corner to navigate back to the previous pivot table view.

To download the table in an *xlsx* format, click the download xlsx icon, represented by a

The vertical columns are organized by activity type, and the horizontal lines are organized by
vehicle.

The entries are color-coded according to the status of each activity. Green activities are scheduled
in the future, yellow activities are due today, and red activities are overdue.

The user responsible for the activity appears in a photo in the lower-left corner of each activity
entry.

The due date of each activity is written in the top-center of each activity entry.
