# Phiếu lương

_Payslips_ are created either by the employees themselves or their managers, and are approved by\
authorized employees (typically managers). Then, once payslips are approved, employees are issued\
payslips and are paid either by check or direct deposit, depending on how their employee profile is\
configured.

The Payslips drop-down header of the Payroll application consists of\
three sections: To Pay, All Payslips, and Batches.

These three sections provide all the tools needed to create payslips for employees, including\
individual payslips, a batch of payslips, or commission payslips.

## Cần thanh toán

Click on Payroll app ‣ Payslips ‣ To Pay to see the payslips that need to be\
paid. On this page, Odoo displays the payslips that have not been generated yet, and can be created\
from this dashboard.

![View all payslips that need to be paid on the Payslips To Pay page.](../../../_images/all-pay-slips.png)

Each payslip lists the Reference number for the individual payslip, the\
Employee name, the Batch Name, the Company, the Basic\
Wage, Gross Wage, Net Wage, and the Status of the payslip.

Click on an individual payslip entry to view the details for that individual payslip.

### Create a new payslip

A new payslip can be created from either the [Payslips To Pay](payslips.md#payroll-to-pay) page or the[Employee Payslips](payslips.md#payroll-all-payslips) page.

Create a new payslip by clicking the New button in the top-left corner.

A blank payslip form is loaded, where the necessary payslip information can be entered.

#### Payslip form

On the blank payslip form, several fields are required. Most of the required fields auto-populate\
after an employee is selected.

Fill out the following information on the payslip form:

*   Employee: type in the name of an employee, or select the desired employee from the\
    drop-down list in this field. This field is **required**.

    **NOTE**

    **Chỉ** nên tạo phiếu lương cho nhân viên đã có trong hệ thống. Nếu chưa có hồ sơ nhân viên (và do đó không có hợp đồng lao động), cần tạo nhân viên mới trong ứng dụng _Nhân viên_ trước khi có thể tạo phiếu lương cho nhân viên đó. Tham khảo tài liệu về [nhân viên mới](../employees/new_employee.md) để biết hướng dẫn chi tiết về thêm một nhân viên.
*   Period: the first day to the last day of the _current_ month auto-populates the\
    Period fields by default. The dates can be changed, if desired.

    To change the start date, click on the first date in the Period field to reveal a\
    pop-up calendar. On this calendar, use the < (less-than) and >\
    (greater-than) icons to select the desired month. Then, click on the desired day to select that\
    specific date.

    Repeat this process to modify the end date for the payslip. These fields are **required**.
* Contract: using the drop-down menu, select the desired contract for the employee. Only\
  the available corresponding contracts for the selected employee appear as options. This field is**required**.
* Batch: using the drop-down menu in this field, select the batch of payslips this new\
  payslip should be added to.
*   Structure: using the drop-down menu, select the salary structure type. Only the\
    corresponding structures associated with the selected contract for the employee appear as options.

    If no employee and/or no contract is selected yet, all available Structures appear in\
    the list. Once an employee and/or contract is selected, any unavailable Structures set\
    for that employee and/or contract do not appear. This field is **required**.

![The top fields for a new payslip all filled out for a February payslip.](../../../_images/new-payslip.png)

#### NOTE

Typically, after making a selection in the Employee field, Odoo auto-populates all\
other required fields (besides the Period field), but **only** if that information is\
already on that employee's form in the _Employees_ app.

#### IMPORTANT

If modifications to auto-populated fields are made, it is recommended to check with the\
accounting department to ensure every entry that affects the _Accounting_ application is correct.

**Worked days & inputs tab**

* Worked Days: the entries under Worked Days (including the\
  Type, Description, Number of Days, Number of\
  Hours, and Amount) are automatically filled in, based on what was entered for the\
  Period, Contract, and Structure fields of the payslip form.
*   Other Inputs: additional inputs affecting the payslip can be entered in this section,\
    such as deductions, reimbursements, and expenses.

    Click Add a line to create an entry in the Other Inputs section.

    Using the drop-down menu in the Type column, select a Type for the input.\
    Next, enter a Description, if desired. Lastly, enter the amount in the\
    Count field.

![The fields filled out in the worked days and inputs tab.](../../../_images/worked-days-tab.png)

**Salary computation tab**

* Salary Computation: the Salary Computation tab is automatically filled in\
  after the Compute Sheet button is clicked. Doing so displays the wages, deductions,\
  taxes, etc. for the entry.
* Has Negative Net To Report: click the checkbox if the employee has a negative net\
  amount for this payslip. This **only** appears if the employee's payslip has a negative balance.

![The fields filled out in the salary computation tab.](../../../_images/salary-comp-tab.png)

**Other info tab**

* Payslip Name: type in a name for the payslip in this field. The name should be short\
  and descriptive, such as `(Employee Name) April 2023`. This field is **required**.
* Company: select the company the payslip applies to using the drop-down menu in this\
  field. This field is **required**.
*   Close Date: enter the date that the payment is made to the employee in this field.

    Click in the field to reveal a calendar pop-up window. Using the < >\
    (less-than/greater-than) icons, navigate to the desired month and year.

    Then, click on the desired date to select it.
* Date Account: enter the date on which the payslip should be posted in this field.
* Salary Journal: this field auto-populates after selecting an existing\
  Employee. This field **cannot** be edited, as it is linked to the _Accounting_\
  application. This field is **required**.
* Accounting Entry: if applicable, this field is automatically populated once the\
  payslip is confirmed. This field **cannot** be modified.
* Add an Internal Note...: any note or reference message for the new entry can be typed\
  in this field.

![The fields filled out in the other info tab.](../../../_images/other-info-tab.png)

#### Process the new payslip

When all the necessary information on the payslip is entered, click the Compute Sheet\
button. Upon doing so, all the information on the payslip is saved, and the Salary\
Computation tab auto-populates, based on the information on the employee's contract or attendance\
records.

If any modifications need to be made, first click the Cancel button, then click the\
Set to Draft button. Make any desired changes, then click the Compute Sheet\
button once again, and the changes are reflected in the Worked Days and\
Salary Computation tabs.

Once everything on the payslip form is correct, click the Create Draft Entry button to\
create the payslip.

Then, a confirmation pop-up window appears, asking Are you sure you want to proceed?.\
Click OK to confirm.

The chatter is automatically updated to show the email sent to the employee, along with a PDF copy\
of the payslip.

#### NOTE

The database may need to be refreshed for the payslip and email to appear.

To print the payslip, click the Print button. To cancel the payslip, click the\
Cancel button.

![The new payslip is emailed to the employee and the email appears in the chatter.](../../../_images/payslip-chatter.png)

Tiếp theo, khoản thanh toán phải được gửi đến nhân viên. Để thực hiện, nhấp vào nút Ghi nhận thanh toán. Thao tác này sẽ hiển thị biểu mẫu bật lên, trong đó cần chọn Sổ nhật ký ngân hàng mong muốn để thực hiện thanh toán từ menu thả xuống. Sau đó, nhấp vào nút Xác nhận để xác nhận sổ nhật ký và quay lại phiếu lương.

#### IMPORTANT

Để một phiếu lương có thể được thanh toán, nhân viên _bắt buộc_ phải có thông tin tài khoản ngân hàng trong phần thông tin liên hệ. Nếu không có thông tin ngân hàng, phiếu lương không thể thanh toán được và hệ thống sẽ hiển thị lỗi khi nhấp vào nút Thanh toán. Thông tin ngân hàng có thể được tìm thấy trong tab [Thông tin cá nhân](../employees/new_employee.md#employees-private-info) trên thẻ nhân viên trong ứng dụng _Nhân viên_. Chỉnh sửa thẻ nhân viên và thêm thông tin ngân hàng nếu thiếu.

![Banking information can be entered in an employee's card.](../../../_images/banking.png)

Odoo automatically checks bank account information. If there is an error with the employee's listed\
bank account, an error appears in a pop-up window, stating, _The employee bank account is_\
_untrusted._ If this error appears, update the employee's bank account information on their[Employee Form](../employees/new_employee.md#employees-private-info).

If a payment needs to be canceled or refunded, click the corresponding Cancel or\
Refund button, located at the top-left of the screen.

      Paid.
