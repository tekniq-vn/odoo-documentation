The reporting function in the **Referrals** app helps recruiters and managers learn where applicants
are applying from, when referred by a current employee. Additionally, the reporting feature shows
the number of applicants hired, refused, and still in the recruitment pipeline, for each medium.

#### IMPORTANT
Only users with *Administrator* rights for the **Recruitment** app have access to the reporting
feature in the **Referrals** app.

## Employees referral analysis report

To access the *Employees Referral Analysis* report, navigate to Referrals app ‣
Reporting. This loads the Employees Referral Analysis report, in a default
<i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i> Bar Chart.

The graph is presented in a <i class="fa fa-database"></i> Stacked view, with the number of
referrals on the y-axis, and the source, referred to as the Medium, of the applicant
(e.g.: *Facebook*, *LinkedIn*, *Email*, etc.) on the x-axis. If a medium does **not** appear on the
report, that indicates there are no referrals from that particular medium.

Referral amounts for all stages are displayed, including Not Hired (refused),
In Progress, and Hired. The default filter is set to the current month.

Hover over any bar to view a popover containing specific data for that particular bar.

In this view, it is easy to see which Medium is the most successful.

### Use case: hired referrals

One way to use the reporting feature is to assess which employees are referring the highest quality
applicants. This is done by examining how many of their referrals go on to become employees.

In this example, data is examined to determined which employee has the highest number of hired
referrals for the current year.

To view this information, first click the <i class="oi oi-view-pivot"></i> (Pivot) icon in the
upper-right corner. Next, remove the current filter in the search bar.

Click the <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i> (down arrow) in the search bar to reveal a drop-down
menu. Click Date in the <i class="fa fa-filter"></i> Filters column, revealing a
drop-down menu of available time periods, and click the current year (in this example,
2024).

Next, click Measures <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>, then deselect Earned Points and
Employee Referral Refused to hide those metrics. Click anywhere on the screen to close
the drop-down menu.

The information displayed shows how many total applicants each employee referred, and how many of
those applicants were hired, for the current year.

In this example, it can be determined that Bob Wilson is the most successful referrer,
with three hired referrals, and nine total referred applicants. Additionally, Mitchell
Admin has the lowest performance in terms of referrals, as he has only one applicant, and no hires.

This information can be helpful to the recruitment team, so they can determine the most active
referrers in the company, and who is the most successful in terms of hires.
