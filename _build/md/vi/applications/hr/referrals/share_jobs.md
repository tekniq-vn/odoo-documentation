# Share job positions

In Odoo *Referrals*, users can earn referral points by sharing job positions with potential
applicants. Job positions can be shared in several ways, through the [View Jobs](#referrals-view-jobs) button and the [Email A Friend](#referrals-email-jobs) button, located
at the bottom of the *Referrals* app dashboard.

#### NOTE
Sharing jobs can **only** occur after onboarding slides have been viewed or skipped.

## Xem công việc

To see all job positions that are actively recruiting candidates, click the View Jobs
button on the main *Referrals* dashboard. This presents all job positions, with each individual job
presented with its own card.

displayed on the card.](../../../.gitbook/assets/jobs1.png)

Each job position card contains the following information:

- The title of the job position. This information is taken from the *Job Position* field of the job
  form.
- The number of Open Positions being recruited. This information is taken from the
  *Expected New Employees* field of the *Recruitment* tab of the job form.
- The points a user earns when an applicant applies for the position.
- The job description detailing the job position. This information is taken from the *Job Position*
  tab of the job form.

To see all the details for a job position, click the More Info button on the specific
card. This opens the job position webpage in a new browser tab. This is what an applicant sees
before applying for a position.

#### NOTE
Only published job positions are visible in the *Referrals* app. To check which job positions are
published or not, refer to the [Job positions](applications/hr/recruitment/new_job.md) documentation.

## Refer friends

To share a job position with someone, click the Refer Friend button on the specific job
position card. A pre-configured Send Job Offer by Mail pop-up window appears. Enter the
recipient's email address in the Email field.

The Subject and Body are populated using a default template. The
Subject `Job for you` is present, by default, but can be modified, if desired.

The specific title of the job position populates the *Job Position* placeholder in the email body.
The `See Job Offer` text in the email body is an individualized tracking link to the specific job
position listed on the website.

When the prospective employee receives the email, the link sends them to the job position page,
where they can apply for the position, and the person who referred them is tracked in the
*Referrals* application.

If desired, add any text or closing salutation to the email body. When all edits have been made,
click Send Mail to send the email, or click Cancel to close the pop-up
window.

## Share a job

Other than sending an email, job positions can be shared, via social media platforms, and by
tracking links to the job position. At the bottom of each job position card are four icons, and
corresponding tracking links, that can be used to share the job position, keeping track of
applicants in the *Referrals* application.

### X (trước đây là Twitter)

A job position can also be shared on X. Click the Share Now button with the

If the user is already signed-in to X, when the Share Now button is clicked, an X page
loads in a new tab with a pre-populated message ready to post, in a draft pop-up window. If the user
is *not* already signed-in, a sign-in screen loads instead, prompting the user to first sign-in to

group of individuals).

Type in any additional information, or make any edits to the message or post, then share using the
available options in LinkedIn.

### Gửi email cho một người bạn

Another way to share job opportunities is to share the entire current list of open job positions,
instead of one job position at a time. To do this, navigate to the Referrals main
dashboard. Click the Email a friend button at the bottom of the screen. A
Send Job Offer by Mail pop-up window appears.

Enter the email address in the Email field. The email can be sent to multiple
recipients by separating each email address with a comma followed by a single space. The
Subject is pre-configured with Job for you, but can be edited.

The email Body is also populated with pre-configured text. The text that appears is:

`Xin chào,`

`There are some amazing job offers in my company! Have a look, they can be interesting for you:`

`See Job Offers`

The See Job Offers text is a tracking link to a complete list of all job positions
currently being recruited for. Add any additional text and make any edits to the message body, if
necessary. Then, click Send Mail to send the email. This sends the message, and closes
the window.
