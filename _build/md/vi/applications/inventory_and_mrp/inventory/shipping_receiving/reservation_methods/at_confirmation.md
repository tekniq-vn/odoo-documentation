## Quy trÃ¬nh

To see the *at confirmation* reservation method in action, create a new  by navigating to
Sales app â€£ New.

Add a customer in the Customer field. Then, in the Order Lines tab, click
Add a product, and select a product to add to the quotation from the drop-down menu.
Finally, in the Quantity column, adjust the desired quantity of the product to sell.

Once ready, click Confirm to confirm the sales order.

Click the ðŸ“ˆ (area graph) icon on the product line to reveal the product's
Availability tooltip, which reveals the Reserved number of units for this
order.

#### NOTE
If there is **not** sufficient quantity of stock for the product included in the , the
ðŸ“ˆ (area graph) icon is red, instead of green.

Instead of revealing the reserved number of units for the order, the Availability
tooltip reads Available, and reveals the available number of units (e.g., `0 Units`).

To deliver the products, click the Delivery smart button at the top of the sales order
form. To confirm that the reservation worked properly, ensure that the Product
Availability field reads `Available` (in green text), and the numbers in the Demand and
Quantity columns match (in this case, both should read `100.00`).
