In Odoo, stock can be replenished one of three ways: *reordering rules*, the *make to order* (MTO)
route, or using the *master production schedule* (MPS).

Each replenishment mechanism triggers the creation or suggestion of a purchase order (PO) or
manufacturing order (MO), with the best choice depending on the business process.

## Replenishment strategies

### Replenishment report and reordering rules

Reordering rules are rules that can be set up to maintain a minimum stock level. They are often
configured to support manufacturing or sales requirements. When a product's stock falls at or below
the minimum level, Odoo generates (or suggests) a purchase or manufacturing order to replenish stock
to the maximum level.

When using automatic reordering rules, Odoo generates a new order. When using manual, Odoo suggests
orders on the replenishment report. For detailed guidance, refer to the [replenishment report](report.md) and [reordering rules](reordering_rules.md).

Key points include:

- [Automatic reordering rules](reordering_rules.md#inventory-warehouses-storage-auto-rr): Automatically create
   or  when stock falls below the minimum level. While this is convenient, it is less
  flexible.
- [Manual reordering rules](reordering_rules.md#inventory-warehouses-storage-manual-rr): Generate suggestions in
  the replenishment report for user review, allowing adjustments and batch orders while meeting
  deadlines.
- [Just-in-time logic](reordering_rules.md#inventory-warehouses-storage-just-in-time): A strategy to replenish
  only what is needed to prevent overstocking.

### Make to order

An  strategy means that procurement or production is triggered only after a sales order has
been confirmed. This strategy is recommended when products are customizable, demand is
unpredictable, there is limited storage capacity, and when products are high in value and low in
demand. In such cases, it does not make sense to keep on-hand inventory.

Unlike products replenished using reordering rules, Odoo automatically links the sales order to the
 or  generated by the  route.

Another difference between reordering rules and  is, with , Odoo generates a draft  or
 immediately after the  is confirmed. With reordering rules, Odoo generates a draft  or
 when the product's forecasted stock falls below the set minimum quantity.

In addition, Odoo automatically adds quantities to the  or  as the forecast changes, so long
as the  or  is not confirmed.

The  route is the best replenishment strategy for products that are customized, and/or for
products that have no stock kept on-hand.

### Kế hoạch sản xuất tổng thể

The  is a dashboard where products and their forecasted
quantities are entered. Based on confirmed manufacturing and purchase orders, the dashboard
recommends amounts to order or produce.

This a useful **manual** tool for keeping track of quantities. The  **should absolutely not** be used alongside reordering rules, as the automated workflow
disrupts its manual replenishment method.
