# Maintenance calendar

Avoiding equipment breakdowns, and blocks in warehouse work centers, requires constant equipment
maintenance. Timely corrective maintenance for machines and tools that break unexpectedly, as well
as preventive maintenance to ensure that such issues are avoided, are key to keeping warehouse
operations running smoothly.

In Odoo *Maintenance*, users can access the *Maintenance Calendar* to create, schedule, and edit
both corrective and preventive maintenance requests, to stay on top of equipment and work centers.

## Create maintenance request

Maintenance requests can be created directly from the *Maintenance Calendar*. To access the
calendar, navigate to Maintenance app ‚Ä£ Maintenance ‚Ä£ Maintenance Calendar.

To create a new request, click anywhere on the calendar. Doing so opens a New Event
pop-up window. In the Name: field, assign a title to the new request.

![New event creation pop-up window.](../../../_images/maintenance-calendar-new-event-popup.png)

Clicking Create on the pop-up window saves the new request with no additional details.
If the request's creation should be canceled, click Cancel.

To add more details and schedule the request for a specific date and time, click Edit.

Clicking Edit opens a blank maintenance request form, where various details about the
request can be filled out.

### Edit maintenance request

In the Request field, assign a title to the new request. In the Created By
field, from the drop-down menu, select which user the request was created by. By default, this field
populates with the user actually creating the request.

![New maintenance request form creation.](../../../_images/maintenance-calendar-new-request-form.png)

In the For field, from the drop-down menu, select if this request is being created for a
piece of Equipment, or a Work Center.

#### NOTE
If Work Center is selected in the For field's drop-down menu, two
additional fields appear on the form: Work Center and Block Workcenter.

In the Work Center field, select which work center in the warehouse this maintenance
request applies to.

If the Block Workcenter option's checkbox is ticked, it is not possible to plan work
orders, or other maintenance requests, in this work center during the time that this request is
being performed.

If Equipment is selected in the For field, which it is by default, select
which machine or tool requires maintenance from the Equipment field. Once a specific
piece of equipment is selected, a greyed-out Category field appears, listing the
*Equipment Category* to which the equipment belongs.

In the Worksheet Template field, if necessary, click the drop-down menu to select a
worksheet template. These templates are custom templates that can be filled out by the employee
performing the maintenance.

Under the Category field, the Request Date field displays the date requested
for the maintenance to happen.

The Maintenance Type field provides two selectable radio button options:
Corrective and Preventive.

Corrective maintenance is for requests that arise for immediate needs, such as broken
equipment, while Preventive maintenance is for planned requests, to avoid breakdowns in
the future.

If this request is tied to a specific , select that  from the Manufacturing
Order field.

From the drop-down menu for the Team field, select the desired maintenance team who will
perform the maintenance. In the Responsible field, select the technician responsible for
the request.

![Filled-out details of maintenance request form.](../../../_images/maintenance-calendar-filled-out-form.png)

In the Scheduled Date field, click the date to open a calendar popover. From this
popover, select the planned date of the maintenance, and click Apply to save the date.

In the Duration field, enter the the amount of hours (in a `00:00` format) that the
maintenance is planned to take.

In the Priority field, choose a priority between one and three ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (stars).
This indicates the importance of the maintenance request.

If working in a multi-company environment, from the drop-down menu in the Company field,
select the company to which this maintenance request belongs.

At the bottom of the form, there are two tabs: Notes and Instructions.

In the Notes tab, type out any internal notes for the team or technician assigned to the
request, if necessary.

In the Instructions tab, if necessary, select one of the three radio button options to
provide maintenance instructions to the assigned team or technician. The available methods for
providing instructions are via PDF, Google Slide, or Text.

## Calendar elements

The *Maintenance Calendar* provides various views, search functions, and filters to help keep track
of the progress of ongoing and planned maintenance requests.

The following sections describe elements found across various views of the calendar.

### Filters and Favorites

To access the maintenance calendar, navigate to Maintenance app ‚Ä£ Maintenance ‚Ä£
Maintenance Calendar.

To add and remove filters for sorting data on the *Maintenance Calendar*, click the üîª

are displayed.

The right-hand side of the drop-down menu lists the Favorites, or any searches that have
been saved as a favorite to be revisited at a later date.

![Favorites section of filters drop-down menu.](../../../_images/maintenance-calendar-favorites-popover.png)

To save a new Favorite search, select the desired Filters. Then, click
Save current search. In the field directly below Save current search, assign
a name to the search.

Under the assigned name, there are two options, to save the current search either as the
Default filter, or as a Shared filter.

Selecting Default filter sets this filter as the default when opening this calendar
view.

Selecting the Shared filter makes this filter available to other users.

Once ready, click Save. When clicked, the new Favorite filter appears in the
Favorites column, and a ‚≠ê (gold star) icon appears with the filter's name in
the search bar.
