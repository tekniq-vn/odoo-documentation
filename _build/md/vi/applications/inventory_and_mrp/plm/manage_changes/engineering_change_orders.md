# Engineering change orders

<a id="plm-eco"></a>

Utilize *engineering change orders* (*ECOs*) to track, implement, and revert change versions made to
products, and [bills of materials](../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration.md).

Engineering change orders can be created:

1. [directly in the ECO type](#plm-eco-create-eco).
2. by an operator in the [tablet view](#plm-eco-tablet-view) of an operation.
3. automatically from feedback submitted to the [ECO type's email alias](eco_type.md#plm-eco-eco-type).

To create a new , begin by navigating to the *PLM* app. Then, select the  type card that
will be used to track the progress of the change. On the Engineering Change Orders page,
click the New button in the top-left corner.

#### NOTE
Learn how to create new [ECO types](eco_type.md#plm-eco-eco-type) to categorize and organize change
orders. Doing so ensures employees only view the  related to their responsibilities,
whether it involves new product introductions, targeted product line updates, or regulatory
compliance fulfillment.

On the  form, fill in the following fields accordingly:

- Description is a brief summary of the improvement.
- Type: specifies the  type project for organizing the .
- Apply on determines if the  changes the Bill of Materials or the

- Product indicates the product being improved.
- Bill of Materials specifies the changed . It auto-populates if the product in
  Product field has an existing . If multiple  exist, select the intended
  radio options from the drop-down menu.
- Company field is used in multi-company databases. Specify if the change applies to
  products in a specific company, or leave blank if the change applies to all companies.
- Responsible represents the assignee in charge of this . (Optional)
- Effective specifies when the  becomes live. Choosing As soon as
  possible means the  applies to the production  as soon as an authorized user
  [applies the changes](#plm-eco-apply-changes).

  On the other hand, choosing At Date, and setting a specific date, leaves a date that
  makes it easier to track the version history of the , and the specific date , used for
  production.
- Tags are assigned to  for prioritization and organization. Create a new tag by
  typing the name in the field and selecting Create from the drop-down menu. (Optional)

After filling out the  form, click the Start Revision button to begin implementing
the changes.

By pressing Start Revision, three actions occur:

   track of all  versions.
3. The stages of the  Type are displayed in the top-right corner of the .

#### NOTE
The Revision smart button is available **only** when the Bill of
Materials radio button is selected in the Apply on field, and the Start
Revision button has been pressed.
