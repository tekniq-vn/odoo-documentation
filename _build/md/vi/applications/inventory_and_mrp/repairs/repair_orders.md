# Process repair orders

Sometimes, products delivered to customers can break or be damaged in transit, and need to be
returned for a refund, delivery of a replacement product, or repairs.

In Odoo, repairs for products returned by customers can be tracked in the *Repairs* app. Once
repaired, products can be redelivered to the customer.

The return and repair process for damaged products typically follows the below steps:

1. [Process return order for damaged product](#repairs-repair-orders-return-order)
2. [Create repair order for returned product](#repairs-repair-orders-repair)
3. [Return repaired product to customer](#repairs-repair-orders-return-customer)
