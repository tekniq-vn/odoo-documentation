## Email marketing dashboard

After installing the application, click the Email Marketing app icon from the main
Odoo dashboard. Doing so reveals the main Mailings dashboard in the default list view.

![View of the main dashboard of the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/mailings-dashboard.png)

In the search bar, the default filter of My Mailings is present to show all the mailings
related to the current user. To remove that filter, click the ‚úñÔ∏è (remove) icon next to
the filter in the search bar. Doing so reveals all the mailings in the database.

The information on the Mailings dashboard has four different view options, located in
the upper-right corner as individual icons.

The view options, from left-to-right, are:

- [List](#email-marketing-list-view) (default view)
- [Kanban](#email-marketing-kanban-view)
- [L·ªãch](#email-marketing-calendar-view)
- [Bi·ªÉu ƒë·ªì](#email-marketing-graph-view)

<a id="email-marketing-list-view"></a>

### Xem danh s√°ch

The list view, represented by the ‚ò∞ (horizontal lines) icon in the upper-right corner,
is the default view of the Mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing app.

While in list view, there are columns dedicated to different aspects of information related to the
listed emails. Those columns are as follows:

- Date: the date the email was sent.
- Subject: the subject of the email.
- Responsible: the user who created the email, or the user who has been assigned to the
  email.
- Sent: how many times the email has been sent.
- Delivered (%): percentage of sent emails that have been successfully delivered.
- Opened (%): percentage of sent emails that have been opened by the recipients.
- Clicked (%): percentage of sent emails that have been clicked by the recipients.
- Replied (%): percentage of sent emails that have been replied to by the recipients.
- Status: the status of the email (Draft, In Queue, or
  Sent).

To add or remove columns, click the Additional Options (two horizontal lines with dots)
icon, located to the far-right of the column titles in list view. Doing so reveals a drop-down menu
of additional column options.

<a id="email-marketing-kanban-view"></a>

### Ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô xem kanban

The Kanban view, represented by the (inverted bar graph) icon, can be accessed in the
upper-right corner of the Mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing app.

![Kanban view of the main dashboard of the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/kanban-view.png)

While in Kanban view, the email information is displayed in the various stages.

The stages are: Draft, In Queue, Sending, and Sent.

- Draft: the email is still being written/created.
- In Queue: the email is scheduled to be sent at a later date.
- Sending: the email is currently being sent to its recipients.
- Sent: the email has already been sent to its recipients.

In each stage, there are drag-and-drop cards representing the emails that have been created/sent,
and the stage they are in represents the current status of that mailing.

Each card on the Mailings dashboard provides key information related to that specific
email.

When the cursor hovers over the upper-right corner of an email campaign card, a ‚ãÆ (three
vertical dots) icon appears. When clicked, a mini drop-down menu reveals the option to color-code
the email, Delete the email, or Archive the message for potential future
use.

![View of the three-dot drop-down menu on the Odoo Email Marketing dashboard.](../../../.gitbook/assets/three-dot-dropdown.png)

<a id="email-marketing-calendar-view"></a>

### Ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô xem l·ªãch

The calendar view, represented by a üìÜ (calendar) icon, can be accessed in the
upper-right corner of the Mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing app.

While in calendar view, a monthly calendar (by default), shows when the mailings have been sent or
are scheduled to be sent.

![Calendar view of the mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/calendar-view.png)

The current date is represented by a üî¥ (red circle) icon over the date on the calendar.

To the right of the calendar, the options to filter the results by Responsible and/or
Status are available, via checkboxes.

In the top-left corner, above the calendar, the option to change the time period being displayed is
available via a drop-down menu, which shows Month, by default. When clicked, the
drop-down menu that appears reveals the options: Day, Week,
Month (default), Year, and Show weekends (selected by default).

Clicking any of those options changes the calendar display to reflect that desired amount of time.

Clicking either ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (left arrow) icon or ‚û°Ô∏è (right arrow) icon changes the
calendar to a previous or future time, depending on what is clicked, based on the chosen amount of
time being represented.

To jump back to the current date, click the Today button.

<a id="email-marketing-graph-view"></a>

### Ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô xem bi·ªÉu ƒë·ªì

The graph view, represented by a (line graph) icon, can be accessed in the upper-right
corner of the Mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing app.

While in graph view, the status of the emails on the Mailings page is represented in a
bar graph, but other graph view options can be implemented, if needed.

![How the Graph view appears in the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/graph-view.png)

In the upper-left corner, above the graph, there is a Measures drop-down menu. When
clicked, different filter options become available to further customize the graph views.

Those Measures options are: A/B Testing percentage and Count
(default).

To the right of the Measures drop-down menu is an Insert in Spreadsheet
button, if the *Documents* application is installed. When clicked, a pop-up window appears, in which
the ability to add the graph to a spreadsheet or dashboard becomes available.

Beside the Measures drop-down menu and Insert in Spreadsheet button are
different graph view options. From left-to-right, those graph view options are: (bar
chart) (default), (line chart), and (pie chart).

#### NOTE
Each graph view option provides its own series of additional view options, which appear to the
right of the selected graph view option.

### Search options

Regardless of the view chosen for the Mailings dashboard in the Email
Marketing app, the Filters, Group by, and Favorites options are
always available to further customize the information being displayed.

To access those options, click the (downward arrow) icon, located to the right of the
search bar. Doing so reveals a drop-down mega menu featuring those filtering and grouping options.

![The drop-down mega menu of search options the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/search-mega-menu.png)

These options provide various ways to specify and organize the information seen on the
Mailings dashboard.

B·ªô l·ªçc

This section of the drop-down mega menu provides different ways to filter email results being
shown on the Mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing app.

![View of filters drop-down menu options on the Odoo Email Marketing dashboard.](../../../.gitbook/assets/filters-dropdown.png)

The options are: My Mailings, Sent Date, A/B Tests,
A/B Tests to review, Archived, and Add Custom Filter.

If Add Custom Filter is selected, Odoo reveals a pop-up window, with three
customizable fields to fill in, in order to create custom filter rules for Odoo to use to
retrieve results that fit more specific criteria.

![Add custom filter pop-up window that appears in Odoo Email Marketing app.](../../../.gitbook/assets/add-custom-filter-popup.png)

Nh√≥m theo

This section of the drop-down mega menu provides different ways to group email results being
shown on the Mailings dashboard in the Email Marketing app.

![View of the Group By drop-down menu on the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/group-by-dropdown.png)

Using this section, the data can be grouped by the messages' Status, or who it was
Sent By.

There is also the option to group the data by Sent Period, which has its own
sub-menu of options to choose from. The Sent Period options are Year,
Quarter, Month, Week, and Day.

If none of the above Group By options deliver the desired results, click
Add Custom Group at the bottom of the Group By section. Doing so
reveals a drop-down menu, wherein custom criteria can be selected and applied, thus delivering
any grouping of data that may be desired.

Y√™u th√≠ch

This section provides the opportunity to save custom filters and/or groupings for future use.
To utilize this section, click the Save current search field, which reveals
additional fields.

![View of the Favorites drop-down menu on the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/favorites-dropdown.png)

Give the favorited filter/grouping a title on the blank line above the checkboxes for
Default filter and Shared.

Ticking the box for Default filter makes this favorited filter/grouping the
default option. Ticking the box for Shared allows other users to see and use this
favorited filter/grouping.

When all desired options are configured, click Save to save the filter/grouping in
the Favorites section of the mega drop-down menu.

## C√†i ƒë·∫∑t

To view and modify the *Email Marketing* settings, navigate to Email Marketing app
‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings.

![View of the Configuration menu with Settings page in the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/configuration-settings.png)

On the Settings page, there are four features available.

![View of the Settings page in the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/settings1.png)

The features are:

- Mailing Campaigns: enables the option to manage mass mailing campaigns.
- Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing: allows recipients to blacklist themselves from
  future mailings during the unsubscribing process.
- Dedicated Server: provides the option to utilize a separate, dedicated server for
  mailings. When enabled, Odoo reveals a new field (and link), in which the specific server
  configurations must be entered, in order for it to connect properly to Odoo.
- 24H Stat Mailing Reports: allows users to check how well mailings have performed a day
  after it has been sent.

<a id="email-marketing-create-email"></a>

## Create an email

To create an email, open the Email Marketing application, and click the
New button in the upper-left corner of the Mailings dashboard page.

Clicking New reveals a blank email form.

![View of a blank email detail form in Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/blank-email-detail-form.png)

On the email form, there are fields for the [Subject](#email-marketing-subject) and
[Recipients](#email-marketing-recipients) of the email.

Beneath that, there are three tabs: [Mail Body](#email-marketing-mail-body), [A/B Tests](#email-marketing-ab-tests), and [Settings](#email-marketing-settings-tab).

<a id="email-marketing-subject"></a>

### Ti√™u ƒë·ªÅ

First, enter a Subject to the email. The Subject is visible in the
recipients' inbox, allowing them to quickly see what the message is about.

#### NOTE
The Subject field is mandatory. An email can **not** be sent without a
Subject.

The (smiley face with a plus sign) icon at the end of the Subject field
represents emojis that can be added to the Subject field. Clicking that icon reveals a
pop-up menu of emojis that can be used.

Beside the (smiley face with a plus sign) icon at the end of the Subject
field is an empty (star) icon. When clicked, the (star) icon turns gold, and
the email is saved as a template in the Mail Body tab, which can be used again in the
future.

<a id="email-marketing-recipients"></a>

### Ng∆∞·ªùi nh·∫≠n

Beneath the Subject field on the email form is the Recipients field. In this
field, select the recipients of the email. By default, the Mailing List option is
selected, but clicking the field reveals a drop-down menu of other recipient options.

With the default Mailing List option selected, a specific mailing list **must** be
chosen from the adjacent Select mailing lists field drop-down menu.

Odoo then sends the email to contacts on that specific mailing list(s).

#### SEE ALSO
[Mailing lists](mailing_lists.md)

When the Recipients field is clicked, a drop-down menu of other options is revealed.
Each option provides different ways Odoo can create a target audience for the email.

![View of recipients drop-down menu in the Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/recipients-dropdown.png)

Those options (excluding the default Mailing List) provide the option to create a more
specified recipient filter, in an equation-like format, which appears beneath the
Recipients field.

The Recipients field options, other than the default Mailing List option,
are as follows:

- Contact: ties specifically to the *Contacts* app, and includes all the contacts
  entered in the database.
- Event Registration: ties specifically to the *Events* app, and provides opportunities
  to interact with event registrants, in order to communicate important information about the
  event(s), or nurture other valuable actions, such as post-event surveys, purchases, etc.
- Lead/Opportunity: ties specifically to records in the *CRM* application, which opens
  up a number of opportunities to influence sales or purchase decisions.
- Li√™n h·ªá g·ª≠i th∆∞: li√™n k·∫øt c·ª• th·ªÉ v·ªõi ·ª©ng d·ª•ng *Marketing qua Email*, t·∫≠p trung v√†o c√°c li√™n h·ªá g·ª≠i th∆∞ ƒë√£ ƒë∆∞·ª£c nh·∫≠p trong ·ª©ng d·ª•ng ƒë√≥ v√† li√™n quan ƒë·∫øn danh s√°ch li√™n h·ªá c·ª• th·ªÉ.

- Sales Order: ties specifically to the *Sales* app, and focuses on a specific sales
  orders in the database.

#### Add recipient filter

To add a more specific recipient filter to any Recipient option, select any recipient
option (other than Mailing List), and click the Modify filter (right-facing
arrow) icon beneath the Recipient field to reveal three subsequent filter rule fields,
formatted like an equation.

It is highly recommended that users implement detailed targeting criteria for the
Recipients field. Typically, a single line of targeting logic is not sufficient enough
for an email campaign.

While the Mailing List option is adequate for the Recipients field, the
Lead/Opportunity and Event Registration options provide far more detailed
targeting criteria, which can be added on top of those seed sources.

To reveal the sub-menu options within the filter rule fields, click each field, and make the desired
selections, until the preferred configuration has been achieved.

The number of records in the database that match the configured rule(s) are indicated
beneath the configured filter rule(s), in green.

![View of how recipient filters can be customized in Odoo Email Marketing.](../../../.gitbook/assets/filter-records.png)

#### NOTE
Some sub-menu options in the first rule field allow for a second choice to provide even more
specificity.

To the right of each rule, there are three additional options, represented by ‚ûï (plus
sign), (sitemap), and üóëÔ∏è (trash) icons.

- The ‚ûï (plus sign) icon adds a new node (line) to the overall targeting logic.
- The (sitemap) icon adds a branch to the node. A branch contains two additional,
  indented sub-nodes that are related to that specific rule, providing even more specificity to the
  parent line above it.
- The üóëÔ∏è (trash) icon deletes a specific node (line) in the array of logic.

<a id="email-marketing-mail-body"></a>

### Mail Body tab

In the Mail Body tab, there are a number of pre-configured message templates to choose
from.

![View of the templates in the Mail Body tab in Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/mail-body-templates.png)

Select the desired template, and proceed to modify every element of its design details with Odoo's
drag-and-drop building blocks, which appear on the right sidebar when a template is chosen.

![View of the building blocks in the Mail Body tab in Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/template-building-blocks.png)

The features on the sidebar used to create and customize emails are separated into three sections:
Blocks, Customize, and Design.

Each building block provides unique features and professional design elements. To use a building
block, drag-and-drop the desired block element onto the body of the email being built. Once dropped,
various aspects of the building block can be customized.

<a id="email-marketing-ab-tests"></a>

### A/B Tests tab

Initially, when the A/B Tests tab is opened on an email form, the only option available
is Allow A/B Testing. This is **not** a required option.

If this option is enabled, recipients are only mailed *once* for the entirety of the campaign.

This allows the user to send different versions of the same mailing to randomly selected recipients
to gauge the effectiveness of various designs, formats, layouts, content, and so on -- without any
duplicate messages being sent.

When the checkbox beside Allow A/B Testing is ticked, an on (%) field
appears, in which the user determines the percentage of the pre-configured recipients that are going
to be sent this current version of the mailing as part of the test.

#### NOTE
The default figure in the on (%) field is `10`, but that figure can be changed at any
time.

Beneath that, two additional fields appear:

The Winner Selection field provides a drop-down menu of options, wherein the user
decides what criteria should be used to determine the "winning" version of the email tests that are
sent.

The options in the Winner Selection field are as follows:

- Manual: allows the user to determine the "winning" version of the mailing. This option
  removes the Send Final On field.
- Highest Open Rate (default): the mailing with the highest open rate is determined to
  be the "winning" version.
- Highest Click Rate: the mailing with the highest click rate is determined to be the
  "winning" version.
- Highest Reply Rate: the mailing with the highest reply rate is determined to be the
  "winning" version.
- Leads: the mailing with the most leads generated is determined to be the "winning"
  version.
- Quotations: the mailing with the most quotations generated is determined to be the
  "winning" version.
- Revenues: the mailing with the most revenue generated is determined to be the
  "winning" version.

The Send Final On field allows users to choose a date that is used to know *when* Odoo
should determine the "winning" email, and subsequently, send that version of the email to the
remaining recipients.

![View of the A/B Tests tab in Odoo Email Marketing application.](../../../.gitbook/assets/ab-test-tab.png)

To the right of those fields is a Create an Alternative Version button. When clicked,
Odoo presents a new Mail Body tab for the user to create an alternate version of the
email to test.

<a id="email-marketing-settings-tab"></a>

### Tab C√†i ƒë·∫∑t

The options present in the Settings tab of the mail form are divided into two sections:
Email Content and Tracking.

#### NOTE
The options available in the Settings tab vary depending on if the *Mailing
Campaigns* feature is activated in Email Marketing ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£
Settings. See [Mailing campaigns](#email-marketing-mailing-campaigns) for more information.

Without the *Mailing Campaigns* feature activated, the Settings tab on the email form
only contains the Preview Text, Send From, Reply To,
Attachments, and Responsible fields.

#### NOTE
If the *Mailing Campaign* feature *is* activated, an additional Campaign field
appears in the Tracking section of the Settings tab.

![View of settings tab in Odoo Email Marketing when campaign setting is activated.](../../../.gitbook/assets/settings-tab-with-campaign.png)

The additional Campaign field allows users to attach this particular email to a
mailing campaign, if desired.

If the desired campaign is not available in the initial drop-down menu, select Search
More to reveal a complete list of all mailing campaigns in the database.

Or, type the name of the desired mailing campaign in the Campaign field, until Odoo
reveals the desired campaign in the drop-down menu. Then, select the desired campaign.

## Send, schedule, test

Once the mailing is finalized, the following options can be utilized, via buttons located in the
upper-left corner of the email form: [Send](#email-marketing-send), [Schedule](#email-marketing-schedule), and [Test](#email-marketing-test).

<a id="email-marketing-send"></a>

### G·ª≠i

The Send button reveals a Ready to unleash emails? pop-up window.

![View of pop-up window that appears when the send button on an email form is clicked.](../../../.gitbook/assets/send-popup.png)

When the Send to all button is clicked, Odoo sends the email to the desired recipients.
Once Odoo has sent the mailing, the status changes to Sent.

<a id="email-marketing-schedule"></a>

### L·ªãch tr√¨nh

The Schedule button reveals a When do you want to send your mailing? pop-up

test email in the Recipients field. Multiple contacts can be added in this field, if
desired.

Once all the desired email addresses have been entered in the Recipients field, click
the Send Test button.

#### WARNING
By default, there's a daily limit applied for **all emails** sent throughout **all
applications**. So, if there are remaining emails to be sent after a limit has been reached,
those mailings are **not** sent automatically the next day. The sending needs to be forced, by
opening the email and clicking Retry.

<a id="email-marketing-mailing-campaigns"></a>

## Mailing campaigns

The *Email Marketing* application provides users with the ability to build mailing campaigns.

In order to create and customize mailing campaigns, the *Mailing Campaigns* feature **must** be

campaigns in the database, and the current stage they are in, showcased in a default Kanban view.

![View of the campaign page in Odoo Email Marketing.](../../../.gitbook/assets/campaigns-page.png)

#### NOTE
This information can also be viewed in a list, by clicking the ‚ò∞ (horizontal lines)
