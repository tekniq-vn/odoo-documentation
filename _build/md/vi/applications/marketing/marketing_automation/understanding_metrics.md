# Campaign metrics

*Campaign metrics* are detailed statistics and analytics within a marketing campaign, measuring its
success and effectiveness. Triggered marketing activities populate relevant activity blocks with
real-time metrics, in the campaign detail form.

## Activity analytics

In the Workflow section of a campaign detail form in the *Marketing Automation* app,
where the various campaign activities are located, a collection of useful data can be found on every
individual activity block, like number of communications Sent, percentage of messages
that have been Clicked, and more.

To the left of the activity block, the configured [trigger time](workflow_activities.md) is
displayed as a duration (either Hours, Days, Weeks, or
Months) if it corresponds to period after the workflow begins.

#### NOTE
If the trigger time is dependent on another activity or triggering action (e.g. Mail:
Replied, etc.) the time is displayed, along with the necessary action for that activity to be
activated (e.g. `Replied after 2 Hours`).

In the activity block, an icon represents each activity type. An ‚úâÔ∏è (envelope) icon
means the activity is an email. Three tiny, interlocking ‚öôÔ∏è (gear) icons means the
activity is an internal action. And, a small, basic üì± (mobile) icon means the activity
is an SMS.

Beside the activity icon, at the top of the activity block, is the title of the activity. To the
right of the activity title, there are Edit and Delete buttons.

Click Edit to open the Open: Activities pop-up form for that specific
activity, in which that activity can be modified. Click the Delete button to completely
delete that specific activity from the workflow.

### Activity graph tab

In every activity block, the Graph (pie chart icon) tab is open by default, displaying
related metrics as a simple line graph. The success metrics are represented in `green` and the
rejected metrics are represented in `red`.

Numerical representations of both Success and Rejected activities are shown
to the right of the line graph.

Beneath the graph in the activity block, for *Email* or *SMS* activity types, a line of accessible
data figures provide a bird's eye view of the campaign activity, including: Sent
(numerical), Clicked (percentage), Replied (percentage), and
Bounced (percentage).

### Activity filter tab

Next to the Graph tab on the activity block, there's the option to open a
Filter tab (represented by a filter/funnel icon).

Clicking the Filter tab on an activity block, reveals what the specific filters are for
that particular campaign activity, and how many records in the database match that specific
criteria.
