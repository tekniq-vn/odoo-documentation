# SMS Marketing

Utilizing  outreach in communication strategies can help
companies expand their market reach, especially in some countries, where emails might not be very
common, or even used at all.

Odoo's *SMS Marketing* application can also help boost conversion rates around valuable actions,
such as event registrations, free trials, purchases, etc., since text and mobile-based marketing
channels typically yield higher  and  outcomes.

## SMS marketing dashboard

When the application is opened, Odoo displays the main SMS Marketing dashboard, which
showcases the various SMS mailings that have been created, along with pertinent information and data
related to that specific message.

The <i class="oi oi-view-kanban"></i> Kanban view is the default Odoo uses when the application is
opened, which provides an organized display of the SMS mailings that have been created, and what
their current status is at the moment.

#### NOTE
An  mailing can have one of the following statuses:
Draft, In Queue, Sending, or Sent.

In the upper right corner of the main SMS Marketing dashboard, there are a few different
view options to choose from. Each one provides a unique take on the same SMS information.

The <i class="oi oi-view-list"></i> List view provides the same useful data related to SMS
mailings, but in a more traditional list layout.

The <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> Calendar view shows when SMS mailings are scheduled or have been
sent. Clicking a future date opens a blank SMS template to be scheduled for that date.

Lastly, the <i class="fa fa-area-chart"></i> Graph view visualizes that same SMS-related data in
series of graphs and charts. Odoo also provides various ways to sort and group the data for more
detailed analysis.
