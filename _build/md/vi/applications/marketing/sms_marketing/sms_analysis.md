# SMS analysis

On the Reporting page (accessible via the Reporting option in the
header menu), there are options to apply different combinations of Filters and
Measures to view metrics in a number of different layouts (e.g. Graph,
List, and Cohort views.)

Each Reporting metric view option allows for more extensive performance analysis of
 mailings.

For example, while in the default Graph view,  data
is visualized as different graphs and charts, which can be sorted and grouped in various ways (e.g.
Measures drop down menu).
