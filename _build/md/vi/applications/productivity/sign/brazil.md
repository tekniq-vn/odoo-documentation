# Odoo Sign legality in Brazil

[Odoo Sign](applications/productivity/sign.md) is your trusted partner for secure, efficient, and legally compliant
electronic signatures in Brazil.

## Legal framework for electronic signatures in Brazil

In Brazil, electronic signatures are regulated under the [Brazilian Civil Code](https://webfiles-sc1.blackbaud.com/files/support/helpfiles/npoconnect-qa/content/resources/attachments/brazil-law-civil-code-13.777-2018.pdf)
and the Provisional Executive Act 2.200-2 (EA 2200) regulations. The law governs transactions
performed through electronic means and the use of electronic signatures. The key points of the law
include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas Brasileira (ICP-Brazil)**: Brazil duy trì cơ sở hạ tầng khóa công khai (PKI) riêng cho chứng chỉ số có tên "Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas Brasileira". Đây là các chứng chỉ chữ ký số hoặc "con dấu" đóng vai trò làm bằng chứng nhận dạng cá nhân cho một mục đích nhất định, có thể được sử dụng trong các trường hợp đặc biệt để cung cấp thêm tính bảo mật. Các chứng chỉ này được cấp bởi Cơ quan Chứng nhận và theo luật định bắt buộc phải có để ký một số loại văn bản nhất định.
