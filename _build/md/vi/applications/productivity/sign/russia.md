# Odoo Sign legality in Russia

[Odoo Sign](applications/productivity/sign.md) is your trusted partner for secure, efficient, and legally compliant
electronic signatures in Russia.

## Legal framework for electronic signatures in Russia

In Russia, electronic signatures are regulated under the [Federal Law No. 63-FZ as of 6 April 2011
"On electronic signature"](https://afyonluoglu.org/PublicWebFiles/e-imza/int-legislation/Russia-Federal%20Law%20on%20e-Signatures.pdf)
and the [Civil Code of the Russian Federation](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/rus_e/wtaccrus58_leg_360.pdf). The law provides the
foundation for the use and legal recognition of electronic signatures. The key points of the law
include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Qualified electronic signatures**: the law recognizes digital signature certificates that serve
  as proof of identity of an individual for a certain purpose that can be used in special cases to
  provide additional security. These certificates are issued by Certification Authorities and are
  required by law for the signature of specific acts.
