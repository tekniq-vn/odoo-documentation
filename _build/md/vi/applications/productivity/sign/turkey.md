# Odoo Sign legality in Turkey

[Odoo Sign](applications/productivity/sign.md) is your trusted partner for secure, efficient, and legally compliant
electronic signatures in Turkey.

## Legal framework for electronic signatures in Turkey

In Turkey, electronic signatures are regulated under the [Electronic Signature Law No.5070](https://www.mevzuat.gov.tr/MevzuatMetin/1.5.5070.pdf), [Code of Obligations No. 6098](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/legislation/details/11084), among other secondary regulations.
The law governs transactions performed through electronic means and the use of electronic
signatures. The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Electronic certificate service provider**: the law recognizes electronic signatures supported by
  digital certificates issued by accredited Certification Service Provider.
