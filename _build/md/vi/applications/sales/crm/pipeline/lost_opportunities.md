# Manage lost opportunities

Not every opportunity results in a successful sale. To keep the pipeline up-to-date, *lost*
opportunities need to be identified. Specifying why an opportunity was lost provides additional
insight that can prove useful for future opportunities.

## Mark an opportunity as lost

To mark an opportunity as lost, first open the CRM app, and select an opportunity
from the pipeline, by clicking on its corresponding Kanban card. Doing so reveals that opportunity's
detail form.

Then, click Lost, located at the top of the opportunity's detail form.

This opens the Mark Lost pop-up window. From the Lost Reason drop-down menu,
choose an existing lost reason. If no applicable reason is available, create a new one by entering
it into the Lost Reason field, and clicking Create.

Additional notes and comments can be added below the lost reason in the designated
Closing Note field.

When all the desired information has been entered in the Mark Lost pop-up window, click
Mark as Lost.

After clicking Mark as Lost, a red Lost banner is added to the upper-right
corner of the opportunity.
