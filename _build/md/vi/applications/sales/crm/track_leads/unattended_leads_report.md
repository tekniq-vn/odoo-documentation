# Unattended leads report

*Unattended leads* are leads that have scheduled activities that are either due or past due.
Whenever an activity is scheduled, Odoo tracks the due date, and sends email reminders to the users
the activity is assigned to.

An *unattended leads report* compiles all active leads in the pipeline with due or past due
activities, allowing a sales manager to identify which opportunities require immediate attention.

By pulling a daily unattended leads report, sales managers can remind their teams to address
outstanding activities before they become past due, helping avoid neglected leads and reinforcing
proactive behaviors in their salespeople.

#### IMPORTANT
In order to pull a unattended leads report, sales teams **must** be regularly utilizing activity
in the *CRM* pipeline, on individual lead and opportunity cards.

It is **not** possible to compile a complete report if the sales people are not using the
*Activities* feature in the *chatter*

## Create an unattended leads report

To create an unattended leads report, first navigate to CRM app â€£ Reporting â€£
Pipeline to open the Pipeline Analysis dashboard. Click into the Search...
bar at the top of the page, and remove all of the default filters.

#### NOTE

the report.

Next, add custom filters by clicking the ðŸ”»(triangle pointed down) icon to the right of
the Search... bar to open the drop-down menu that contains Filters,
Group By, and Favorites columns. Under the Filters column,

The Add Custom Filter pop-up window allows for the creation of more specific filters.

### Add custom filters

In order to generate an unattended leads report, filters need to be created for the following
conditions:

> - [Past due activities](#unattended-leads-report-past-due): limits the results to only include
>   leads with an assigned activity where the due date has past. This can be altered to include
>   activities due to occur on the date the report is generated as well.
> - [Unassigned leads](#unattended-leads-report-exclude-unassigned): excludes leads without an
>   assigned salesperson.
> - [Specific sales teams](#unattended-leads-report-sales-team): limits results to only include
>   leads assigned to one or more sales teams. This filter is optional and should not be included if
>   the report is intended for the entire company.
