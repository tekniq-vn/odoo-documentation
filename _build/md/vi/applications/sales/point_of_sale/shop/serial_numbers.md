# Serial numbers and lots

Working with **serial numbers** and **lots** allows tracking your products' movements. When products
are tracked, the system identifies their location based on their last movement.

To enable traceability, go to Point of Sale ‣ Products ‣ Products. Then,
select a product and check the Tracking By Unique Serial Number or the
Tracking By Lots box in the Inventory tab.

where you can type or scan the product's serial or lot numbers. To add more than one of the same
tracked products, click on **enter** to validate and start a new line.
