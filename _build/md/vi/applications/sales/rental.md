## Trang t·ªïng quan

Upon opening the *Rental* application, the Rental Orders dashboard is revealed.

![Example of the Rental Orders dashboard available in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-orders-dashboard.png)

In the default kanban view, all rentals are visible. Each rental card displays the customer name,
the price of the rental, the related sales order number, along with the status of the rental.

#### NOTE
Rental kanban cards that do **not** display a rental status means those rentals have confirmed
quotations, but have not been picked up yet.

On the left sidebar, the Rental Status for each rental can be found. Beneath that, the
Invoice Status of the rentals is accessible. Clicking any option in the left sidebar
filters the displayed rentals on the dashboard.

## C√†i ƒë·∫∑t

To configure additional rental delay costs, availability of rental items, or minimum time of rental,
navigate to Rental app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings.

![How the Settings page appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-settings.png)

In the Rental section, there are options to configure Default Delay Costs
and Default Padding Time. There is also the option to activate Rental
Transfers and Digital Documents.

- Default Delay Costs are additional costs for late returns.
- Default Padding Time represents the minimum amount of time between two rentals.
- Rental Transfers means stock deliveries and receipts can be used for rental orders.
- Digital Documents allows users to upload documents for customers to sign prior to
  : confirming their rental.

In the Rent Online section, there are options to configure a Minimal Rental
Duration and designate Unavailability days, or days during which pickup and return are
not possible.

applicable).

## Gi√° cho thu√™

To adjust the rental pricing on a product, go to the Products page in the *Rental* app,
then select the desired product or click New to create a new product from scratch.

On the product form, ensure the Can be Rented checkbox is ticked. Then, open the
Rental prices tab.

![How the Settings page appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/rental-prices-tab.png)

#### NOTE
If creating a rental product outside of the *Rental* app, just ensure the Can be
Rented checkbox is ticked on the product form. By default, this checkbox is ticked whenever a
product is created directly in the *Rental* application.

### ƒê·ªãnh gi√°

Under the Pricing section of the Rental prices tab, designate custom rental
prices and rental periods for the product.

To add pricing for a rental, click Add a price. Then, choose a *pricing period*
() in the Period column, or create a new
pricing period by typing in the name and clicking Create.

Next, decide whether or not to apply this custom rental price to a specific Pricelist.

Lastly, enter the desired Price for that specific Period.

#### NOTE
There is no limit to how many pricing lines can be added. Multiple pricing options for rental
products are typically used to give discounts for customers who agree to longer rental durations.

To delete any rental pricing option, click the üóëÔ∏è (trash) icon, and that row is
deleted.

### D·ª± tr·ªØ

Under the Reservations section of the Rental prices tab, there is the option
to configure additional fines for any Extra Hour or Extra Day that the
customer takes to return a rental.

There is also the option to set a Security Time, expressed in hours, to make the rental
product temporarily unavailable between two rental orders. Such a feature may prove useful if
maintenance or cleaning is required between rentals.

### Price computing

Odoo always uses two rules to compute the price of a product when a rental order is created:

1. Only one price line is used.
2. The cheapest line is selected.

Documents feature has been activated in the *Rental* application settings. To do so, navigate to
Rental app ‚Ä£ Configuration ‚Ä£ Settings, activate Digital

automatically installs it after activating the Digital Documents setting.

customer via the customer portal.

Odoo guides the customer through the signing process with clear, clickable indicators, and allows
them to create electronic signatures to quickly complete the form.

![The adopt your signature pop-up window that appears in the Odoo Rental application.](rental/adopt-signature-popup.png)

Document button at the bottom of the document.
