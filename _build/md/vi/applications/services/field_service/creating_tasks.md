# Creating field service tasks

Tasks in Odoo Field Service can be created manually or automatically, including from sales orders or
helpdesk tickets.

## Manual task creation

To create a new field service task:

1. Open the Field service app and go to Field Service ‣ All Tasks ‣ All Tasks.
2. Nhấp Mới.
3. Fill in the task title, Customer and any other [optional field](../project/tasks/task_creation.md#task-creation-task-configuration),
   then save manually.

## Task creation from a sales order

This feature allows for field service tasks to be automatically created from a sales order. When you
create a quotation with the [service product](../../sales/sales/invoicing/time_materials.md#sales-invoicing-configured-service-product)
and confirm it, a task is automatically created in your Field Service project. Click the
Tasks smart button to access it from the sales order.

## Task creation from a helpdesk ticket

If you have the Helpdesk app installed, you can [create field service tasks from a helpdesk
ticket](../helpdesk/advanced/after_sales.md#helpdesk-field).
