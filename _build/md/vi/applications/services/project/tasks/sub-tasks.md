# Nhiệm vụ phụ

When handling project tasks, you can often benefit from splitting the workload into smaller
**sub-tasks**, making it easier to track progress and manage the work.

Odoo’s sub-task feature is particularly useful in some of the following cases:

- The task workload is too big to handle in one record.
- There’s a clear sequence of steps to follow.
- Some parts of the workload fall under the scope of different projects and/or assignees.

The original task to which sub-tasks are linked is referred to as the **parent task**. The sub-tasks
of the parent task are known as **child tasks**.

To create a sub-task:

1. Open the Project app, then go into your desired project.
2. Click the task where you want to add the sub-task, then click the Sub-tasks tab.
3. Click Add a line, then fill in the Title.
4. Click the <i class="fa fa-cloud-upload"></i> (save) icon to save the task manually.

Once the new sub-task is created, the following changes occur in the parent task:

- A **smart button** displays the total number of sub-tasks, as well as the number of closed
  (**done** or **canceled**) sub-tasks. Click the smart button to access the list of the sub-tasks.
- The Allocated time displays the amount of time allocated to the parent task, as well
  as time allocated to the sub-tasks. This can be used to ensure that the time allocated to
  sub-tasks does not exceed time allocated to the parent task.
- The Timesheets tab includes a breakdown of time spent on the parent task as well as
  sub-tasks.

Click View to open the sub-task you created. The sub-task form is identical to the
[task form](task_creation.md#task-creation-task-configuration).
