You can customize the **checkout steps**, add more content using the **website builder**, and enable
additional features such as **express checkout** and **sign in/up at checkout**.

You can use **building blocks** to add content at any step of the checkout process. To do so, from
any **checkout page**, go to Edit ‣ Blocks, and drag and drop **building blocks**
to the page.

#### NOTE
Note that content added through building blocks is **specific** to each step.

## Checkout steps

### Review order: promo code (and subtotal)

If you have enabled Discounts, Loyalty, & Gift Card in the settings
(Website ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Shop - Products), you can enable the
Promo Code field (Edit ‣ Customize) from any checkout page. Customers
can then redeem gift cards and promotional codes at the Review Order step.

Furthermore, you can display the subtotal with discounts applied by enabling Show
Discount in Subtotal.

### Address: B2B fields

Optional TIN/VAT and Company Name fields can be added to the
Billing Address form for B2B customers, at the Address step. To add the
fields, go to Edit ‣ Customize from any checkout page, and enable
Show B2B fields.

### Request extra info (additional step)

You can request Extra Info from the customer by adding an Extra Info step
between the Address and Confirm Order steps. To do so, go to
Edit ‣ Customize from any checkout page, and enable Extra Step
Option.

The Extra Info step is an online form linked to the quotation or sales order of the
customer. The information added during that step can be found on the quotation or sales order of the
customer from the back end, in the **Sales** app.

When enabled, you can remove, add, and modify fields of the form by clicking on Edit in
the top-right corner, and then clicking on any of the form's fields. All customization options, as
well as the + Field button to add new fields, are available at the bottom of the
Customize menu under the Field section.

You can ask customers to agree to the Terms & Conditions in order to confirm their order
by enabling Accept Terms & Conditions under Edit ‣ Customize on any
checkout page.

You can enable a Buy Now button on products' pages which instantly takes the customer to
the Confirm Order checkout page, instead of adding the product to the cart. To do so, go
to Website ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Shop - Checkout Process section and
tick Buy Now. Alternatively, the Buy Now button can also be enabled from any
product's page by going Edit ‣ Customize, in the Cart section.

The button can be found next to the Add to Cart button on the product's page.

## Guest and signed-in checkout

It is possible to introduce a **checkout policy** under which customers can either checkout as
**guests** or **signed-in users only**. Customers can also checkout as guest, and **optionally sign
up later** in order to track their order, if enabled.

To select a policy, go to Website ‣ Configuration ‣ Settings ‣ Shop - Checkout
Process. You can choose between:

- Optional: allows guests to checkout and later register from the **order confirmation**
  email to track their order;
- Disabled (buy as guest): customers can only checkout as guests;
- Mandatory (no guest checkout): customers can only checkout if they have signed-in.

If you wish to restrict checkout only to **selected B2B customers**, enable Mandatory (no
guest checkout) and go to Website ‣ eCommerce ‣ Customers. Select the customer
you wish to **grant access to**, click Action ‣ Grant portal access, and click
Grant Access.

#### NOTE
Users can only have one portal access per **email**. They *cannot* be granted access to two
different portals with the same **email address**.

### Shared customer accounts

If you enable Shared Customer Accounts under Website ‣ Configuration
‣ Settings ‣ Privacy section, you can allow or disallow access to *all* websites for one same
account.
