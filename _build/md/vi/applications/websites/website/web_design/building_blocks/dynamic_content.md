## Biểu mẫu

The Form block is used to collect information from website visitors and create records
in your database.

### Tác vụ

By default, submitting the form **sends you an email** containing what the visitor entered.
Depending on the apps installed on your database, new actions that can automatically create records
become available:

- Apply for a Job (Recruitment)
- Create a Customer (eCommerce)
- Create a Ticket (Helpdesk)
- Create an Opportunity (CRM)
- Subscribe to Newsletter (Email Marketing)
- Create a Task (Project)

Select another action with the Action field found under the Customize tab's
Form section.

By default, actions redirect visitors to a *thank you* page after submitting the form. Use the
URL field to change where they are redirected. It is also possible to let visitors stay
on the form's page by selecting Nothing or Show Message under the
On Success field.

### Trường

To add a new field to the form, click the + Field button found next to the Customize
tab's Form or Field section. By default, new fields are *text* fields. To
change the type, use the Type field and select an option under the Custom
Field heading.

It is also possible to select an Existing Field from a database and use the data it
contains. The fields available depend on the selected action.
