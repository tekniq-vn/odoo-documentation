The website configurator provides a range of Structure [building blocks](../building_blocks.md) to design your website's layout, including headings, images, and text.

Below are presented two types of structure blocks: [Banner](#structure-banner) and
[Masonry](#structure-masonry).

#### NOTE
To add a building block, click Edit, select the desired building block under the
Blocks tab, and drag and drop it onto the page. To access its settings, click it and
go to the Customize tab, where the available options depend on the type of block
selected.

## Banner

The Banner block combines a title, text, images, and a call to action button, making it
suitable for placement at the top of a website.

### Call to action

The call to action button encourages visitors to take a specific action, for example, consulting
your shop, downloading a file, or making an appointment.
