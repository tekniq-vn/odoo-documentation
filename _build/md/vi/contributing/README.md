#### IMPORTANT
It is mainly Odoo employees who develop new features for the codebase and write new content for
the documentation. Be sure to discuss any idea for a new feature or page with the Odoo team so
they can give you the green light before you begin working on it. Some features may already be in
development on their side, and only approved features can be merged.
