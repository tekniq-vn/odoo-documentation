[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). It is a command-line
() tool that allows tracking the history of changes made to a file and, more
importantly, working on different versions of that file simultaneously. It means you do not need to
worry about overwriting someone elseâ€™s pending work when making changes.

Verify that the installation directory of Git is included in your system's `PATH` variable.

Linux and macOS

Follow the [guide to update the PATH variable on Linux and macOS](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059) with the installation path of Git (by default
`/usr/bin/git`).

Windows

Follow the [guide to update the PATH variable on Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/)
with the installation path of Git (by default `C:\Program Files\Git`).
