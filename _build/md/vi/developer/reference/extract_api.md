# Extract API

Odoo provides a service to automate the processing of documents of type **invoices**, **bank statements**,
**expenses** or **resumes**.

The service scans documents using an  engine and then
uses -based algorithms to extract fields of interest such as the
total, due date, or invoice lines for *invoices*, the initial and final balances, the date for
*bank statements*, the total, date for *expenses*, or the name, email, phone number for *resumes*.

This service is a paid service. Each document processing will cost you one credit from your
document digitization  account. More information about  accounts can be found
[here](applications/essentials/in_app_purchase.md).

You can either use this service directly in the Accounting, Expense, or Recruitment App or through
the API. The Extract API, which is detailed in the next section, allows you to integrate our
service directly into your own projects.

## Overview

The extract API uses the [JSON-RPC2](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol; its endpoint routes are located at
`https://extract.api.odoo.com`.

<a id="extract-api-version"></a>

### Version

The version of the Extract API is specified in the route.

The latest versions are:
: - invoices: 123
  - bank statements: 100
  - expenses: 132
  - applicant: 102

### Flow

The flow is the same for each document type.

1. Call [/parse](#extract-api-parse) to submit your documents (one call for each
   document). On success, you receive a `document_token` in the response.
   <br/>
2. You then have to regularly poll [/get_result](#extract-api-get-result) to get the
   document's parsing status.
   <br/>
   Alternatively, you can provide a `webhook_url` at the time of the call to
   [/parse](#extract-api-parse) and you will be notified (via a POST request) when the
   result is ready.
   <br/>

The HTTP POST method should be used for all of them. A python implementation of the full flow for
invoices can be found [`here`](extract_api/implementation.py) and a token for integration
testing is provided in the
[integration testing section](#latestextract-api-integration-testing).

## Parse

Request the digitization of a document. The route will return a `document_token` that you can use
to fetch the result of your request.

#### Common fields

<a id="latestextract-api-get-result-feature-result"></a>

##### `feature_result`

Each field of interest we want to extract from the document such as the total or the due date are
also called **features**. An exhaustive list of all the extracted features associated to a type of
document can be found in the sections below.

For each feature, we return a list of candidates and we spotlight the candidate our model predicts
to be the best fit for the feature.

`selected_value` (optional)
: The best candidate for this feature.

`selected_values` (optional)
: The best candidates for this feature.

`candidates` (optional)
: List of all the candidates for this feature ordered by decreasing confidence score.

```js
"feature_name": {
    "selected_value": candidate_12,
    "candidates": [candidate_12, candidate_3, candidate_4, ...]
}
```

##### candidate

For each candidate we give its representation and position in the document. Candidates are sorted
by decreasing order of suitability.

`content`
: Representation of the candidate.

`coords`
: `[center_x, center_y, width, height, rotation_angle]`. The position and dimensions are
  relative to the size of the page and are therefore between 0 and 1.
  The angle is a clockwise rotation measured in degrees.

`page`
: Page of the original document on which the candidate is located (starts at 0).

```js
"candidate": [
    {
        "content": string|float,
        "coords": [float, float, float, float, float],
        "page": int
    },
    ...
]
```

#### Invoices

Invoices are complex and can have a lot of different fields. The following table gives an exhaustive
list of all the fields we can extract from an invoice.

| Feature name       | Specificities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Integration Testing

You can test your integration by using *integration_token* as `account_token` in the
[/parse](#extract-api-parse) request.

Using this token put you in test mode and allows you to simulate the entire flow without really
parsing a document and without being billed one credit for each successful **document** parsing.

The only technical differences in test mode is that the document you send is not parsed by the
system and that the response you get from
[/get_result](#extract-api-get-result) is a hard-coded one.

A python implementation of the full flow for invoices can be found
[`here`](extract_api/implementation.py).
