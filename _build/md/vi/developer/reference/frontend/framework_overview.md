# Framework Overview

## Introduction

The Odoo Javascript framework is a set of features/building blocks provided by
the `web/` addon to help build odoo applications running in the browser. At
the same time, the Odoo Javascript framework is a single page application,
usually known as the *web client* (available at the url `/web`).

The web client started as an application made with a custom class and widget
system, but it is now transitioning to using native javascript classes instead,
and Owl as a component system. This explains why both systems are currently in
use in the codebase.

From a high-level perspective, the web client is a single-page application: it
does not need to request a full page from the server each time the user performs
an action. Instead, it only requests what it needs and then replaces/updates the
current screen accordingly. Also, it manages the url to keep it in sync with
the current state.

The javascript framework (all or some parts) is also used in other situations,
such as the Odoo website or the point of sale. This reference is mostly focused
on the web client.

#### NOTE
It is common in the Odoo ecosystem to see the words *frontend* and *backend*
as synonyms for the odoo website (public) and the web client, respectively.
This terminology is not to be confused with the more common use of
browser-code (frontend) and server (backend).

#### NOTE
In this documentation, the word *component* always refers to new Owl
components, and *widget* refers to old Odoo widgets.

#### NOTE
All new development should be done in Owl, if possible!

## Code structure

The `web/static/src` folder contains all the `web/` javascript (and css and
templates) codebase. Here is a list of the most important folders:

- `core/` most of the low level features
- `fields/` all field components
- `views/` all javascript views components (`form`, `list`, ...)
- `search/` control panel, search bar, search panel, ...
- `webclient/` the web client specific code: navbar, user menu, action service, ...

The `web/static/src` is the root folder. Everything inside can simply be
imported by using the `@web` prefix. For example, here is how one can import
the `memoize` function located in `web/static/src/core/utils/functions`:

```javascript
import { memoize } from "@web/core/utils/functions";
```

## WebClient Architecture

As mentioned above, the web client is an owl application. Here is a slightly
simplified version of its template:

```xml
<t t-name="web.WebClient">
    <body class="o_web_client">
        <NavBar/>
        <ActionContainer/>
        <MainComponentsContainer/>
    </body>
</t>
```

As we can see, it basically is a wrapper for a navbar, the current action and
some additional components. The `ActionContainer` is a higher order component
that will display the current action controller (so, a client action, or a
specific view in the case of actions of type `act_window`). Managing actions
is a huge part of its work: the action service keeps in memory a stack of
all active actions (represented in the breadcrumbs), and coordinates each
change.

Another interesting thing to note is the `MainComponentsContainer`: it is
simply a component that displays all components registered in the
`main_components` registry. This is how other parts of the system can extend
the web client.

## Environment

As an Owl application, the Odoo web client defines its own environment (components
can access it using `this.env`). Here is a description of what Odoo adds to
the shared `env` object:

| Key        | Value                                                                                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `qweb`     | required by Owl (contains all templates)                                                                           |
| `bus`      | [main bus](#frontend-framework-bus), used to coordinate some generic events                                        |
| `services` | all deployed [services](services.md#frontend-services) (should usually be accessed<br/>with the `useService` hook) |
| `debug`    | string. If non empty, the web client is in [debug mode](#frontend-framework-debug-mode)                            |
| `_t`       | translation function                                                                                               |
| `isSmall`  | boolean. If true, the web client is currently in mobile mode (screen width <= 767px)                               |

So, for example, to translate a string in a component (note: templates are
automatically translated, so no specific action is required in that case), one
can do this:

```javascript
const someString = this.env._t('some text');
```

#### NOTE
Having a reference to the environment is quite powerful, because it provides
access to all services. This is useful in many cases: for example,
user menu items are mostly defined as a string, and a function taking the `env`
as unique argument. This is enough to express all user menu needs.

## Building Blocks

Most of the web client is built with a few types of abstractions: registries,
services, components and hooks.

### Registries

[Registries](registries.md#frontend-registries) are basically a simple key/value mapping
that stores some specific kind of objects. They are an important part of the
extensibility of the UI: once some object is registered, the rest of the web
client can use it. For example, the field registry contains all field components
(or widgets) that can be used in views.

```javascript
import { registry } from "./core/registry";

class MyFieldChar extends owl.Component {
    // some code
}

registry.category("fields").add("my_field_char", MyFieldChar);
```

Note that we import the main registry from `@web/core/registry` then open the
sub registry `fields`.

### Services

[Services](services.md#frontend-services) are long lived pieces of code that provide a
feature. They may be imported by components (with `useService`) or by other
services. Also, they can declare a set of dependencies. In that sense, services
are basically a DI (dependency injection) system. For example, the `notification`
service provides a way to display a notification, or the `rpc` service is the
proper way to perform a request to the Odoo server.

The following example registers a simple service that displays a notification
every 5 second:

```javascript
import { registry } from "./core/registry";

const serviceRegistry = registry.category("services");

const myService = {
    dependencies: ["notification"],
    start(env, { notification }) {
        let counter = 1;
        setInterval(() => {
            notification.add(`Tick Tock ${counter++}`);
        }, 5000);
    }
};

serviceRegistry.add("myService", myService);
```

### Components and Hooks

[Components](owl_components.md#frontend-components) and [hooks](hooks.md#frontend-hooks) are ideas coming from the
[Owl component system](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md).
Odoo components are simply owl components that are part of the web client.

[Hooks](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/hooks.md) are a
way to factorize code, even if it depends on lifecycle. This is a
composable/functional way to inject a feature in a component. They can be seen
as a kind of mixin.

```javascript
function useCurrentTime() {
    const state = useState({ now: new Date() });
    const update = () => state.now = new Date();
    let timer;
    onWillStart(() => timer = setInterval(update, 1000));
    onWillUnmount(() => clearInterval(timer));
    return state;
}
```

## Context

An important concept in the Odoo javascript is the *context*: it provides a way
for code to give more context to a function call or a rpc, so other parts of the
system can properly react to that information. In some way, it is like a bag of
information that is propagated everywhere. It is useful in some situations, such
as letting the Odoo server know that a model rpc comes from a specific form view,
or activating/disabling some features in a component.

There are two different contexts in the Odoo web client: the *user context* and
the *action context* (so, we should be careful when using the word *context*: it
could mean a different thing depending on the situation).

#### NOTE
The `context` object may be useful in many cases, but one should be careful
not to overuse it! Many problems can be solved in a standard way without
modifying the context.

<a id="frontend-framework-user-context"></a>

### User Context

The *user context* is a small object containing various informations related to
the current user. It is available through the `user` service:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends Component {
    setup() {
        const user = useService("user");
        console.log(user.context);
    }
}
```

It contains the following information:

| Name                  | Type       | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `allowed_company_ids` | `number[]` | the list of active company ids for the user               |
| `lang`                | `string`   | the user language code (such as "en_us")                  |
| `tz`                  | `string`   | the user current timezone (for example "Europe/Brussels") |

In practice, the `orm` service automatically adds the user context to each of
its requests. This is why it is usually not necessary to import it directly in
most cases.

#### NOTE
The first element of the `allowed_company_ids` is the main company of the user.

### Action Context

The [ir.actions.act_window](../backend/actions.md#reference-actions-window) and
[ir.actions.client](../backend/actions.md#reference-actions-client) support an optional `context` field.
This field is a `char` that represents an object. Whenever the corresponding
action is loaded in the web client, this context field will be evaluated as an
object and given to the component that corresponds to the action.

```xml
<field name="context">{'search_default_customer': 1}</field>
```

It can be used in many different ways. For example, the views add the
action context to every requests made to the server. Another important use is to
activate some search filter by default (see example above).

Sometimes, when we execute new actions manually (so, programmatically, in javascript),
it is useful to be able to extend the action context. This can be done with the
`additional_context` argument.

```javascript
// in setup
let actionService = useService("action");

// in some event handler
actionService.doAction("addon_name.something", {
    additional_context:{
        default_period_id: defaultPeriodId
    }
});
```

In this example, the action with xml_id `addon_name.something` will be loaded,
and its context will be extended with the `default_period_id` value. This is a
very important usecase that lets developers combine actions together by providing
some information to the next action.

## Python Interpreter

The Odoo framework features a built-in small python interpreter. Its purpose
is to evaluate small python expressions. This is important, because views in
Odoo have modifiers written in python, but they need to be evaluated by the
browser.

Example:

```javascript
import { evaluateExpr } from "@web/core/py_js/py";

evaluateExpr("1 + 2*{'a': 1}.get('b', 54) + v", { v: 33 }); // returns 142
```

The `py` javascript code exports 5 functions:

### tokenize(expr)

* **Đối số:**
  * **expr** (`string()`) -- the expression to tokenize
* **Trả về:**
  Token[] a list of token

### parse(tokens)

* **Đối số:**
  * **tokens** (`Token[]()`) -- a list of tokens
* **Trả về:**
  AST an abstract syntax tree structure representing the expression

### parseExpr(expr)

* **Đối số:**
  * **expr** (`string()`) -- a string representing a valid python expression
* **Trả về:**
  AST an abstract syntax tree structure representing the expression

### evaluate(ast)

* **Đối số:**
  * **ast** (`AST()`) -- a AST structure that represents an expression
  * **context** (`Object()`) -- an object that provides an additional evaluation context
* **Trả về:**
  any the resulting value of the expression, with respect to the context

### evaluateExpr(expr)

* **Đối số:**
  * **expr** (`string()`) -- a string representing a valid python expression
  * **context** (`Object()`) -- an object that provides an additional evaluation context
* **Trả về:**
  any the resulting value of the expression, with respect to the context

<a id="frontend-framework-domains"></a>

## Domains

Broadly speaking, domains in Odoo represent a set of records that matches some
specified conditions. In javascript, they are usually represented either as a
list of conditions (or of operators: `|`, `&` or `!` in prefix notation), or as string
expressions. They don't have to be normalized (the `&` operator is implied if
necessary). For example:

```javascript
// list of conditions
[]
[["a", "=", 3]]
[["a", "=", 1], ["b", "=", 2], ["c", "=", 3]]
["&", "&", ["a", "=", 1], ["b", "=", 2], ["c", "=", 3]]
["&", "!", ["a", "=", 1], "|", ["a", "=", 2], ["a", "=", 3]]

// string expressions
"[('some_file', '>', a)]"
"[('date','>=', (context_today() - datetime.timedelta(days=30)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))]"
"[('date', '!=', False)]"
```

String expressions are more powerful than list expressions: they can contain
python expressions and unevaluated values, that depends on some evaluation context.
However, manipulating string expressions is more difficult.

Since domains are quite important in the web client, Odoo provides a `Domain`
class:

```javascript
new Domain([["a", "=", 3]]).contains({ a: 3 }) // true

const domain = new Domain(["&", "&", ["a", "=", 1], ["b", "=", 2], ["c", "=", 3]]);
domain.contains({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }); // true
domain.contains({ a: -1, b: 2, c: 3 }); // false

// next expression returns ["|", ("a", "=", 1), ("b", "<=", 3)]
Domain.or([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('b', '<=', 3)]"]).toString();
```

Here is the `Domain` class description:

### *class* Domain()

* **Đối số:**
  * **descr** (`string | any[] | Domain()`) -- a domain description

### Domain.contains(record)

* **Đối số:**
  * **record** (`Object()`) -- a record object
* **Trả về:**
  boolean

Returns true if the record matches all the condition specified by the domain

### Domain.toString()

* **Trả về:**
  string

Returns a string description for the domain

### Domain.toList()

* **Đối số:**
  * **context** (`Object()`) -- evaluation context
* **Trả về:**
  any[]

Returns a list description for the domain. Note that this method takes an
optional `context` object that will be used to replace all free variables.

```javascript
new Domain(`[('a', '>', b)]`).toList({ b:3 }); // [['a', '>', 3]]
```

The `Domain` class also provides 4 useful static methods to combine domains:

```javascript
// ["&", ("a", "=", 1), ("uid", "<=", uid)]
Domain.and([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('uid', '<=', uid)]"]).toString();

// ["|", ("a", "=", 1), ("uid", "<=", uid)]
Domain.or([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('uid', '<=', uid)]"]).toString();

// ["!", ("a", "=", 1)]
Domain.not([["a", "=", 1]]).toString();

// ["&", ("a", "=", 1), ("uid", "<=", uid)]
Domain.combine([[["a", "=", 1]], "[('uid', '<=', uid)]"], "AND").toString();
```

#### *static* Domain.and(domains)

* **Tham số:**
  **domains** (*string* *[* *]*  *|* *any* *[* *]* *[* *]*  *|* *Domain* *[* *]*) -- a list of domain representations
* **Trả về:**
  Domain

Returns a domain representing the intersection of all domains.

#### *static* Domain.or(domains)

* **Tham số:**
  **domains** (*string* *[* *]*  *|* *any* *[* *]* *[* *]*  *|* *Domain* *[* *]*) -- a list of domain representations
* **Trả về:**
  Domain

Returns a domain representing the union of all domains.

#### *static* Domain.not(domain)

* **Tham số:**
  **domain** (*string* *|* *any* *[* *]*  *|* *Domain*) -- a domain representation
* **Trả về:**
  Domain

Returns a domain representing the negation of the domain argument

#### *static* Domain.combine(domains, operator)

* **Tham số:**
  * **domains** (*string* *[* *]*  *|* *any* *[* *]* *[* *]*  *|* *Domain* *[* *]*) -- a list of domain representations
  * **operator** ( *'AND'* *or*  *'OR'*) -- an operator
* **Trả về:**
  Domain

Returns a domain representing either the intersection or the union of all the
domains, depending on the value of the operator argument.

<a id="frontend-framework-bus"></a>

## Bus

The web client [environment](#frontend-framework-environment) object contains an event
bus, named `bus`. Its purpose is to allow various parts of the system to properly
coordinate themselves, without coupling them. The `env.bus` is an owl
[EventBus](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/reference/event_bus.md),
that should be used for global events of interest.

```javascript
// for example, in some service code:
env.bus.on("WEB_CLIENT_READY", null, doSomething);
```

Here is a list of the events that can be triggered on this bus:

| Message                     | Payload                                                                                   | Trigger                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACTION_MANAGER:UI-UPDATED` | a mode indicating what part of the ui has been updated ('current', 'new' or 'fullscreen') | the rendering of the action requested to the action manager is done                   |
| `ACTION_MANAGER:UPDATE`     | next rendering info                                                                       | the action manager has finished computing the next interface                          |
| `MENUS:APP-CHANGED`         | none                                                                                      | the menu service's current app has changed                                            |
| `ROUTE_CHANGE`              | none                                                                                      | the url hash was changed                                                              |
| `RPC:REQUEST`               | rpc id                                                                                    | a rpc request has just started                                                        |
| `RPC:RESPONSE`              | rpc id                                                                                    | a rpc request is completed                                                            |
| `WEB_CLIENT_READY`          | none                                                                                      | the web client has been mounted                                                       |
| `FOCUS-VIEW`                | none                                                                                      | the main view should focus itself                                                     |
| `CLEAR-CACHES`              | none                                                                                      | all internal caches should be cleared                                                 |
| `CLEAR-UNCOMMITTED-CHANGES` | list of functions                                                                         | all views with uncommitted changes should clear them, and push a callback in the list |

## Browser Object

The javascript framework also provides a special object `browser` that
provides access to many browser APIs, like `location`, `localStorage`
or `setTimeout`.  For example, here is how one could use the
`browser.setTimeout` function:

```javascript
import { browser } from "@web/core/browser/browser";

// somewhere in code
browser.setTimeout(someFunction, 1000);
```

It is mostly interesting for testing purposes: all code using the browser object
can be tested easily by mocking the relevant functions for the duration of the
test.

It contains the following content:

| `addEventListener`   | `cancelAnimationFrame`   | `clearInterval`         |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| `clearTimeout`       | `console`                | `Date`                  |
| `fetch`              | `history`                | `localStorage`          |
| `location`           | `navigator`              | `open`                  |
| `random`             | `removeEventListener`    | `requestAnimationFrame` |
| `sessionStorage`     | `setInterval`            | `setTimeout`            |
| `XMLHttpRequest`     |                          |                         |

<a id="frontend-framework-debug-mode"></a>

## Debug mode

Odoo can sometimes operate in a special mode called the `debug` mode. It is used
for two main purposes:

- display additional information/fields for some particular screens,
- provide some additional tools to help developer debug the Odoo interface.

The `debug` mode is described by a string. An empty string means that the `debug`
mode is not active. Otherwise, it is active.  If the string contains `assets` or
`tests`, then the corresponding specific sub modes are activated (see below). Both
modes can be active at the same time, for example with the string `assets,tests`.

The `debug` mode current value can be read in the [environment](#frontend-framework-environment):
`env.debug`.

#### SEE ALSO
- [Activate the debug mode](../../../applications/general/developer_mode.md#developer-mode)

<a id="frontend-framework-assets-debug-mode"></a>

### Assets mode

The `debug=assets` sub mode is useful to debug javascript code: once activated,
the [assets](assets.md#reference-assets) bundles are no longer minified, and source-maps
are generated as well. This makes it useful to debug all kind of javascript code.

<a id="frontend-framework-tests-debug-mode"></a>

### Tests mode

There is another sub mode named `tests`: if enabled, the server injects the
bundle `web.assets_tests` in the page. This bundle contains mostly test tours
(tours whose purpose is to test a feature, not to show something interesting to
users). The `tests` mode is then useful to be able to run these tours.
