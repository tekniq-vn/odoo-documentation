# Discover the web framework

* [Chapter 1: Owl components](01_owl_components.md)
* [Chapter 2: Build a dashboard](02_build_a_dashboard.md)

This two parts tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of the web framework. Whether
you are new to the framework or have some prior experience, this tutorial will provide you with a
solid foundation for using the web framework in your projects.

The first part covers the basics of Owl components, which
are a key part of the web framework. Owl components are reusable UI components that can be used
to build complex web interfaces quickly and efficiently. We will explore how to create and use Owl
components in Odoo. Then, in the second part of this tutorial, we focus on creating a dashboard using various
features of Odoo. Dashboards are an essential part of any web application, and provide a nice starting
point to use and interact with the Odoo codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development with Odoo in general
(models, controllers, QWeb, ...). If you are new to Odoo, we recommend that you start with the
[Server framework 101](../server_framework_101/) tutorial before proceeding with this one.

#### NOTE
Each chapter of this tutorial is an independant project.  If you feel comfortable with Owl, you can
start directly with chapter 2.
