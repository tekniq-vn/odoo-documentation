# Chapter 15: The final word

## Coding guidelines

We will start refactoring the code to match to the Odoo coding guidelines. The guidelines aim
to improve the quality of the Odoo Apps code.

**Reference**: you will find the Odoo coding guidelines in
[Coding guidelines](../../../contributing/development/coding_guidelines.md).

## Test on the runbot

Odoo has its own  server named [runbot](https://runbot.odoo.com/). All
commits, branches and PR will be tested to avoid regressions or breaking of the stable versions.
All the runs that pass the tests are deployed on their own server with demo data.
